  primaryObjectives: 'Primary objectives include: eliminating design conflicts before construction through rigorous clash detection protocols, optimising building performance through integrated analysis and simulation, enabling efficient construction through accurate quantity extraction and sequencing models, supporting sustainability targets through embedded carbon analysis and energy modeling, and facilitating seamless handover with structured asset data for predictive maintenance and space management.',
  collaborativeProductionGoals: 'Collaborative production goals focus on establishing unified data standards across all disciplines, implementing real-time model coordination through federated workflows, ensuring consistent information delivery at all project milestones, maintaining version control integrity throughout design development, facilitating transparent communication through shared visualisation platforms, and creating comprehensive audit trails for decision-making accountability whilst adhering to ISO 19650 information management principles.',
  alignmentStrategy: 'Our alignment strategy implements weekly coordination meetings with federated model reviews, establishes clear responsibility matrices for information production and validation, deploys standardised naming conventions and file structures across all disciplines, utilises automated quality checking workflows to ensure compliance, maintains continuous training programmes for team competency development, and implements performance monitoring through defined KPIs including model accuracy, delivery timeliness, and information completeness metrics.',
  cdeStrategy: 'The project employs a federated CDE approach utilizing multiple specialized platforms to optimize workflow efficiency and data management across different information types and project phases. Each platform is selected for its specific strengths while maintaining seamless integration and unified information governance through standardized protocols, consistent naming conventions, and automated synchronization processes.',
