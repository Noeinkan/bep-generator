Executive summary
The international information management standards ISO 19650–1:2018 and ISO 19650–2:2018 define
the recommended concepts and principles for information management using building information
modelling (BIM), as well as specifying the activities to be undertaken to support the delivery phase of
an asset.
During the tender process, the lead appointing party will create a pre-appointment BIM execution plan
(pre-BEP) that proposes how a potential delivery team would undertake the information management
activities on the project. This includes any suggested amendments or additions to the proposed project’s
information standards, as well as the information production methods and procedures.
Upon appointment, the delivery team’s BIM execution plan (BEP) will be confirmed by the lead
appointing party. This typically involves updating their pre-appointment BEP (pre-BEP) to include any
feedback from the appointing party. Any agreed changes to the information standards, information
production methods and procedures will be made by the appointing party and should remain separate
from the delivery team’s BIM execution plan (BEP) but still form part of the appointment. Before finalising
the BIM execution plan, there should be further collaboration with the wider delivery team/all task teams.
It should confirm the team’s methodology to meet the appointing party’s information requirements,
defining a common approach for the whole delivery team to adopt in order to meet each information
delivery milestone.
This guidance has been designed to assist with both the production of the pre-appointment BIM
execution plan (pre-BEP) and, upon appointment, the development of the delivery team’s BIM execution
plan (BEP). Both the template and this corresponding guidance document have been structured to
include the information delivery strategy (Section 2), which will be required for both iterations of the
execution plans and production methods and procedures adjustments (Section 3), which is only for pre-
appointment/tender.
When filling in the relevant template, it is important to remember the key purpose of the BIM execution
plans:
• The pre-appointment BIM execution plan (pre-BEP) is for proposing an approach, including
suggesting adjustments to the project information standards, information production method
and production.
• The delivery team’s BIM execution plan (BEP) is to confirm the delivery team’s approach only.
Note: The BIM execution plan (BEP) should reflect/respond to the exchange information requirements
(EIR), and therefore any sections that do not correlate to the information requirements or information
management processes (ISO 19650 series principles), or provide any project-specific information,
should be omitted.

The design shall be coordinated throughout the project, with each stage complying with the delivery
team’s detailed responsibility matrix (Section 4.1). As each task team with design responsibility is
engaged, they will participate fully in the design development process that is relevant to their works, as
per the federation strategy.
This will be continually reviewed and monitored throughout. Each task team is responsible for the
coordination of their design, and any current or potential issue should be identified using the
comment/review functionality on the common data environment (CDE) and the resolution agreed during
coordination meetings. This will also be supported by lead appointed party clash detection activities,
where the agreed test and tolerances will be performed before the coordination meeting. The agreed
resolution of each clash will be documented and distributed to the delivery team. A full report will be
submitted to the appointing party following each meeting.
Table 3.5 (below) outlines the delivery team’s process and responsibilities.

Project-wide clash tolerance list The lead appointed party shall be responsible for facilitating
the agreed clash tolerance list. Each task team shall be
responsible for contributing their required clash sets and
tolerances.
Production and distribution of clash rendition Each task team shall be responsible for uploading a suitable
models into the CDE version of the clash rendition models, as agreed.
Federation of the clash rendition models The lead appointed party will federate the clash rendition
models and check for accuracy of location, orientation and
appropriate supply of information from the supply chain.
Running clash tests The lead appointed party will import and run the agreed
clash list and tolerance list. Once imported, the tests shall
be run to produce results. The report is to be shared prior to
coordination workshops.
Evaluation of clash results During the coordination workshop, the lead appointed party
shall evaluate the results of the clashes and assign actions
according to the owner of the clash. A clash resolution
report shall be posted after the meeting.
Action tracking Task assignees shall be responsible for resolving clashes
logged.
Progress reports The clash model will be shared with embedded clashes
maintaining a single source of information. Clash progress
reports will be produced monthly by the lead appointed party
as a separate spreadsheet for review at the monthly
coordination workshops.
To create a more efficient method of conducting the project clash renditions, Table 3.6 (below) proposes
splitting the rendition into separate clash tests with the described tolerances.

Executive summary
To successfully implement BIM, a project team must perform detailed and comprehensive
planning. This BIM Execution Plan (BEP) ensures that all parties are clearly aware of the
opportunities, technicalities and responsibilities associated with the implementation of BIM on the
project.
It is important the project team always work to the latest revision of the Project BEP,
RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX and
AIDP available on the CDE.
Bim objectives
This BEP responds to the EIR noting the proposed strategic objectives of both the Employer and
BakerHicks and the project activities to be undertaken. A summary of these objectives and

SCOPE
This BEP is used to document the decisions made by the project team to capture information when
working through the BIM execution plan process. It is associated with the Building Information
Modelling standard ISO 19650-1 and PAS1192-2.
The BIM Execution Plan defines uses for BIM on every project (e.g. design authoring, cost
estimating, and design coordination), along with a detailed design of the process for executing BIM
throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, this plan defines roles and responsibilities detailing
scope of information to be shared, relevant business processes and supporting software.
At the outset of a project, the team needs to document the BIM strategy, which is managed and
maintained by the BIM Coordinator/Manager. The project teams including consultants who are
collaborating with the BIM are to familiarise themselves with these documents and apply the BIM
standards to their work.

4.3 VOLUME STRATEGY
Large projects may need to be split into several volumes or zones to facilitate efficient
manipulation in the virtual environment. This helps reduce file sizes for; use, upload and download
when working in a collaborative manner. This process must be managed by the Lead Designer.
Volume plans and naming conventions to be shared via the CDE.
The volume strategy needs to be defined at project outset, as volume codes are included in the
file naming protocol denoted in Section 4.2. The table below specifies the project volume strategy.
Volume Code Description
Z1 Volume 1
Z2 Volume 2
To be used if model has not been split or includes multiple

4.11 PROJECT INFORMATION MODEL (PIM) DELIVERY STRATEGY
Specific requirements of Stakeholders must be considered to enable effective coordination. To
ensure that all information is accessible to all parties please follow the guidance detailed below.
Any deviation from this table must be agreed with the Information Manager.
Item Description
No more than one building shall be modelled in a single file and contain only data from
1
one discipline.
Model files and information should not exceed 200MB. Should the file size be breached,
2
the model shall be segregated following the Volume Strategy defined in Section 4.3.
Where multiple models make up a single project, a container model should be
3 considered whose function it is to federate the models. Federated models should not
exceed 500MB.
Placeholder volumes for key items such as ceilings, under floor voids and bespoke
manufacture are to be defined at an early stage. Any changes to these placeholder
4
volumes cannot be changed without agreement from all stakeholders. Placeholder
volumes will be subdivided and ownership passed as the design is progressed.

Abstract
The major requirement of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is to
effectively manage information gathered from different project stakeholders. A structured
guideline requires for managing the process and information productively. The first global
Building Information Modeling (BIM) standards, BS ISO 19650-1 and BS ISO 19650-2, are
recently published for managing information over the whole life cycle of a built asset using
BIM. The research objective of this study is to develop and implement a BIM execution plan
(BEP) based on BS EN ISO 19650‐1 and BS EN ISO 19650‐2, and identify the benefits of
using BS EN ISO 19650 standards in the BIM-based construction projects. The results of this
study indicate that using ISO 19650 standards in the BIM projects allows stakeholders to (1)
demonstrate a significant value proposition for purpose-driven, structured, verified and
validated information models, (2) support data exchange in a collaborative information
management system efficiently, and (3) minimize data over processing. This study makes a
significant contribution to the AEC literature and industry by presenting the development and
implementation process of a BIM Execution Plan based on BS EN ISO 19650‐1 and BS EN
ISO 19650‐2 standards, and benefits of BS ISO 19650-based BIM projects. This study will
promote the use of ISO 19650 standards in the BIM-based construction projects.
Keywords: ISO 19650, BIM, Building Information Modeling, BIM Execution Plan

1. Introduction
Implementing standards and performing data management in the construction projects
streamline processes that in turn increase the value in the architecture, engineering, and
construction (AEC) industry. System and software standardization help professionals minimize
the project cost, reduce the need for specialized expertise, consolidate the vendor management,
reduce incompatibility, and simplify the infrastructure and the ecosystem [1]. Construction
projects may include a number of stages, or gateways, at which information is collated or
produced. In such projects, consultants, clients, contractors and subcontractors generate huge
amounts of data. Hence, information management becomes more significant for the
construction project stakeholders. Information management ensures the parties to manage the
resources in the most effective way with the aim of achieving the employer’s project
requirements (EPRs) [2]. Especially, information management is highly significant in the large-
scale construction projects including multiple stakeholders from different disciplines due to
numerous data. Such a problem can be solved by applying a standardized methodology
throughout the project delivery process. For this purpose, the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) published the first global Building Information Modeling (BIM)
standards which are BS EN ISO 19650‐1 and BS EN ISO 19650‐2. These standards represent
a significant step for systematizing the information management requirements in the BIM-based
construction projects with an internationally agreed set of concepts and principles [4]. BS EN
ISO 19650‐1 and BS EN ISO 19650‐2 can be applied any sort of construction projects
regardless of the project size and complexity. The ISO 19650 series describe the latest industry
standards and best practices for managing information in the construction projects.
Furthermore, BS EN ISO 19650‐1 and BS EN ISO 19650‐2 can be used for standardizing the
project life cycle that in turn provides a transparent information flow, a good structure for data
capture and a clear view for operational process in the construction projects [1]. Currently, any
BIM standard or any converted standard does not exist in Turkey. The research objective of this
study is to develop and implement a BIM execution plan (BEP) based on BS EN ISO 19650‐1
and BS EN ISO 19650‐2, and identify the benefits of using BS EN ISO 19650 standards in the
BIM-based construction projects. It is expected that this study promotes the use of ISO 19650
standards in the BIM-based construction projects. Using a BS EN ISO 19650 standards based
BEP in the construction projects allows parties to demonstrate a significant value proposition
for developing structured, purpose-driven, verified and validated information models which
supports data exchange in a collaborative information management system efficiently,
minimizes data over processing and satisfies employer’s information requirements.
2. Research Methodology
The research methodology of this study consists of three steps which are semi-structures
interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs), literature review and case study, respectively.
These methods were selected in order to integrate different perspectives on the subject domain.
The information gathered by these research methods was triangulated for the purpose of
determining the benefits and requirements of ISO 19650-1,2 standards in the BIM-based
construction projects.
In the first step of this study, face-to-face semi structured interviews were performed with two
SMEs in order to determine the benefits and requirements of the BIM standards. These
interviews were conducted to gather the details of the published standards and the necessity of
them in the BIM-based construction projects. In these interviews, the requirements and
2
deficiency of standardization, possible solution recommendations and applications of ISO
19650 standards including the relevant procedures and processes throughout the project design,
construction and operation were discussed. Two interviewees are Civil Engineer. One of these
interviewees has 25 years of experience in the AEC industry, the other has 10 years of
experience. The first interviewee had PhD degree, and works as a Director of Engineering &
Design in an international company. The second interviewee has MSc degree, and works as a
Senior Information Management Lead in an international company.
In the second step, a literature review was performed. This technique was selected as one of the
data collection method in this study because reviewing literature allows researchers to
determine the major requirements of the AEC industry, and obtain detailed information on the
subject domain. BS EN ISO 19650‐1 entitled “Organization and digitization of information
about buildings and civil engineering works, including building information modelling (BIM)-
Information management using building information modelling - Part 1: Concepts and
principles” and BS EN ISO 19650‐2 entitled “Organization and digitization of information
about buildings and civil engineering works, including building information modelling (BIM) -
Information management using building information modelling - Part 2: Delivery phase of the
assets, and Transition guidance to BS EN ISO 19650” were examined and used in this study
for developing the BIM execution plan. In the literature review, keywords were used for
reducing subjectivity and obtaining detailed information on the subject matter. Publications
with any of the following keywords were identified: ‘ISO 19650’, ‘BIM Standards’ and ‘BIM
and ISO 19650’. Studies published between 2018 and 2020 were analyzed using databases such
as Elsevier, IOP Science and Google Scholar in the literature review. The reason of short
timeframe is that ISO 19650 standards were published in 2018. A total of five conference
papers, one book and 3 journal articles were reviewed manually. The reason of the limited
publications considered within the scope of this study is that a few studies based on ISO 19650
standards exist in the literature.
In the third step, a case-study was executed using 2D plans of a construction project. In the case
study, a BIM Execution Plan (BEP) was developed according the ISO 19650-1,2 standards.
Considering the BEP, 3D BIM model of the project including structural, architectural, and
mechanical plans, 4D model of the project including the clash detections, scheduling were
performed, respectively.
3. Development of BIM Execution Plan
BIM Execution Plan is a guideline that explains how the information management aspects of
the appointment will be carried out by the project team throughout the project delivery process
[6]. This comprehensive document helps project teams identify and execute BIM in the various
phases of construction management process [5]. Developing a detailed BIM execution plan and
effectively integrating BIM into the project delivery process are highly important in terms of
project success.
To develop a BEP based on ISO 19650 standard frameworks and requirements, first, the BEP
must be provided by a prospective lead appointed party in their tender response. According to
ISO 19650-2, the BEP is one of the several resources developed by the lead appointed party
(i.e. contractor) on behalf of the delivery team to convey the information management approach
3
[7]. 1 BIM Execution Plan is a succinct resource which is supplemented by additional resources
to be used by the prospective delivery team if appointed [8].
BIM Execution Plan has two different purposes in supporting the tender process that are
appointment1 and information delivery activities. These activities provide evidence to the
appointing party1 that in turn allows the prospective delivery team to manage project
information toward any information requirements supported to them (pre-appointment BEP),
and present a delivery tool [8]. The appointed delivery team1 will use the delivery tool for
producing, managing and exchanging project information during the appointment alongside
other resources [7]. Although only one BEP exists for each delivery team, there may be two
early versions of it; because, BEP is an alive document, and expected from the project
participants to keep the document updated in case of any change in information or workflow.
The first version is for the (pre-appointment) BEP, and the second version offers an update in
case of alteration; thereby, the revised BEP can fulfil the project goals as an appointment
resource.
According to ISO 19650-2, a simplified process leading up to the (pre-appointment) BIM
execution plan composed of three steps [7]. In the first step, ISO 19650-2 Clause 5.1, the
appointing party identifies the project wide information requirements and other resources. In
the second step, ISO 19650-2 Clause 5.2, the appointing party defines the appointment specific
Exchange Information Requirements (EIR) and issues tender information to prospective lead
appointed parties. The last step, ISO 19650-2 Clause 5.3, the prospective lead appointed party
develops a (pre-appointment) BEP that is returned alongside other tender response resources
[7]. Further, the (pre-appointment) BEP should covers seven different key information
management assessments as recommended in ISO 19650-2 clause 5.3.2. These assessments
provide (1) the details of individuals undertaking the information management function, (2)
proposed information delivery strategy, (3) proposed federation strategy to be adopted by the
delivery team, (4) the delivery team’s high-level responsibility matrix, (5) proposed
adds/amends to project’s information production methods and procedures (if there are any), (6)
proposed adds/amends to project’s information standard (if there are any), and (7) proposed
schedule of software, hardware and IT infrastructure [7]. As the BEP is a formal appointment
resource, it will need to be subject to a change management process throughout the appointment
process. Additionally, this document serves as a series of defined project level instructions
including guidelines on the method of integrated BIM processes that are followed throughout
the project delivery process.
Within the scope of the research a BIM execution plan was developed and implemented in a
case study. Development and implementation of BEP was illustrated by IDEF0 diagram (Fig
1). In the first step, a BIM execution plan was developed in accordance with the ISO 19650
standard’s frameworks and requirements, and its mechanism was provided with BEP cycle.
Then, BIM implementation was performed in a construction project according to the BEP
document prepared in the first step.
1 Appointments is agreed instruction for the provision of works, goods or services. Appointed party is provider of
works, goods or services. Appointing party is receiver of works, goods or services from a lead appointed party.
Delivery team is lead appointed and their appointed parties. [6]

BIM process implemented using the BEP which was developed according to ISO 19650-1, 2
standards. In the scope of BIM implementation, the architectural, structural and mechanical 3D
BIM model designed using the determined LOD specification via Revit 2020. The structural
3D BIM model was sketched which includes structural elements such as column, beams with
respect to 2D model of plan. During drawing process, the models, files, families, views and
clashes were entitled, and the quality was controlled correctly according to the constituted BEP,
respectively. In the next step, with the use of these models the clash test was launched, detected,
and resolved consummately. First clash test was performed between structural and mechanical
models. The second test was executed between architectural and mechanical models. Then, the
results of clash tests were reported. The clash test conducted by rules such as tolerance was
0.000 m. After performing the clash tests, totally 28 clashes between structural and mechanical,
and 508 clashes between architectural and mechanical were detected. The project schedule was
created via MS Project 2018 in detail. Totally, the project workflow includes 126 activities. In
the last step, the 4D modelling of the project was conducted by linked the imported 3D view of
elements with respect to relevant activity from the imported schedule by using Navisworks
2020. Simulation was made after linking all activities with the 3D view in Revit.
5. Results
According to the triangulation of literature review and face-to-face semi structured interviews
with SMEs, eight benefits of using ISO 19650 standards in the BIM-based construction projects
were identified. These benefits are represented in Table 1 with their related source of data.

According to the SMEs’ comments, A#2 is the prominent benefit of using ISO 19650 standards
in the BIM-based construction projects. . In case of the employer’s information requirements
(EIRs) may not specify at the beginning of the project, and could cause major problems in terms
of cost and time. By the virtue of ISO 19650 standards, employer's information requirements
will be identified in tender process, and involved in the contracts that in turn assist project teams
to prevent possible non-value added activities such as delays, defects. Further, A#6 and A#2
have a cause-effect relation. If the EIRs are identified in the tender process, these requirements
can be met efficiently with the limited non-value added activities. Similarly, A#1, A#3, A#4,
A#5 and A#7 have a cause and effect relation. Applying ISO 19650 standards in the BIM-based
construction projects ensures the use of common data environment (CDE) that in turn
digitalizes the processes, enables project teams to manage the information management process
and prevents non-value added activities. Generally, except A#7, the other benefits are
interrelated issues. A#6 shows that even intricate BIM-based construction projects can be
efficiently managed throughout project life cycle by using ISO 19650 standards.
6. Discussion & Conclusions
This paper presents the development and implementation process of a BIM Execution Plan
based on BS EN ISO 19650‐1 and BS EN ISO 19650‐2 standards, and identifies eight benefits
of using ISO 19650 standards in the BIM-based construction projects by conducting, semi-
structured interviews with SMEs, literature review and case study. This study makes a
significant contribution to the AEC literature and industry by presenting the development and
implementation process of a BIM Execution Plan based on BS EN ISO 19650‐1 and BS EN
ISO 19650‐2 standards, and benefits of BS ISO 19650-based BIM projects. This research will
7
promote the use of ISO 19650 standards in the in the construction projects. Accordingly, this
study will increase the awareness of importance for the usage of ISO 19650 standards in the
BIM-based construction projects. Results of this study can be used by all stakeholders involved
in the BIM-based construction projects.
According to the experts’ comments, A#1, A#2, A#3, A#4, A#5, A#6 and A#8 are interrelated
benefits and have a cause-effect relation among them. Experts also highlighted that A#2 is the
most prominent benefit because if the employer’ project requirements are identified at the
beginning of the tender process in detail, the project success can be reached in terms of time
and cost. A#6 presents that ISO 19650 standards can be adopted in any size and complexity of
the construction project throughout the whole project life cycle. All these benefits prove that
the use of ISO 19650 standards in the BIM-based construction projects streamline the processes
by minimizing non-value added activities such as delays, paperwork and defects.
Findings of the study indicate that considering ISO 19650 standards framework and
requirements in the BIM-based projects allows project stakeholders to demonstrate a significant
value proposition which are structured, purpose-driven, verified, and validated information
models. The value proposition supports data exchange throughout a collaborative information
management system efficiently, minimizes data over processing, and satisfies employer’s
information requirements. According to the SMEs’ comments, using a BEP based on the ISO
19650 allows project teams to conduct the data management system by standardizing the
information throughout the project delivery process.
A future direction of this study could be developing a BEP in accordance with ISO 19650
standards for various types of buildings such as hospital, industrial building and shopping
center. Another future direction could be analyzing and developing a BEP considering the ISO
19650-3, ISO 19650-4 and ISO 19650-5.

A BEP describes how the information the appointing party requires will be delivered and how the project will be executed, monitored and controlled with regard to BIM – who does what, when and how. It is crucial to the success of a project.
There are two types:
The pre-appointment BEP which is prepared by prospective lead appointed party in response to the appointing party’s exchange information requirements (EIR) and supporting invitation to tender information. See AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.3.2.
Delivery team’s BEP: Following the appointment of the successful tenderer, the lead appointed party – in agreement with appointed parties – should update and confirm any changes required to the pre-appointment BEP. This appointment BEP is known as the delivery team’s BEP. See AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.4.1.
(Delivery team) Combined Template
This Template can be used for projects where the client or appointing party do not have their own. It includes content for both design and construction stages of projects. It is specifically for delivery team BEPs. Use the NATSPEC pre-appointment BEP Template for those types of BEPs.
When preparing the delivery team BEP, refer to the pre-appointment BEP and update relevant details as required. This will ensure consistency and save effort.
The Template must be edited to reflect project-specific requirements. In doing so, the party/parties assume responsibility for its content.
The BEP should be updated throughout the project as required to reflect the delivery team’s response to changing circumstances and new insights gained during execution.
Using this Template
This Template includes prompts for eliciting BEP content and provides a structure for organising it effectively.
See Appendix E – Planning information delivery for an explanation of its structure and instructions for its use.
Delivery Team BIM Execution Plan (BEP) document
AS ISO 19650 alignment
This document is aligned with the requirements of the AS ISO 19650 series of standards and uses the terminology from them throughout. Refer to them for details of the requirements and definitions of terms.
Definitions of terms can also be found on the ISO Online Browsing Platform (OBP): https://www.iso.org/obp/ui
A basic understanding of the concepts, principles and terminology found in the AS ISO 19650 series is crucial for making effective use of this Template. See the NATSPEC National BIM Guide for an introduction to the subject.
Purpose
Apart from demonstrating to the appointing party that due consideration has been given to planning the information delivery process for their project, the BEP is essential for informing all members of the delivery team about the organisation of the process and their place in it.
This BEP describes the proposed approach by the lead appointed party to the execution, monitoring and control of BIM for this project in response to the appointing party’s requirements.
Application
Applicable project phases:
Examples of options – adjust wording to suit the project:
This Delivery Team BIM Execution Plan applies to the design phases of the project only, up to and including the handover of the project information model (PIM) and asset information model (AIM) from the design team to the construction team.
This Delivery Team BIM Execution Plan applies to the construction phases of the project only, from the handover of the PIM and AIM from the design team to the construction team and up to and including the handover of the AIM from the construction team to the operators of the completed building.
This Delivery Team BIM Execution Plan applies to the design and construction phases of the project, up to and including the handover of the AIM from the design and construction teams to the operators of the completed building.
The last option offers the most opportunities to realise the potential benefits of BIM.
Design status:
A brief description of the point design development has reached prior to appointment will also give a clearer picture of the scope of the project, without having to infer it from the details included in the BEP alone. Ideally, this would have been included in the pre-appointment BEP.
Include any additional details that provide useful contextual information for the BEP.
Development sequence: Always create a Design BEP (DBEP) prior to developing a Construction BEP (CBEP).
Updates and revisions
Lead appointed party responsibilities: Review and update the BEP in consultation with the delivery team to make sure the project remains on schedule and meets project requirements.
Recording updates and revisions: When updating or revising the delivery team BEP, edit it using a word processing application with track changes turned on to highlight any changes. Once agreed by the delivery team and the appointing party, accept changes and record a summary of them in the Version history table on the page before the Table of Contents.
Project details
Project description
Outline description:
Insert a brief description of the project and/or refer to documents that describes it in more detail.
Project goals
The appointing party’s goals for the project are shown in the Project goals table.
Project goals table
Copy project goals from the asset information requirements (AIR), project information requirements (PIR) or EIR to provide overall context for the next sections of the BEP.
Priority: e.g. High, Medium, Low, 1, 2, 3, etc. Define numerical designations to make it clear what is meant by each.
Goal description: A brief description, e.g. Increase cost certainty. Refer to the goals described in the AIR and PIR when summarising them here.
Measures of success: Quantifiable where possible, e.g. reduced number of requests for information.
If goals are documented elsewhere, you may prefer to delete the table and reference the relevant document instead.
Commercial
Procurement strategy
The project procurement strategy is shown in the Project procurement strategy table.
Project procurement strategy table
Insert the details documented elsewhere, e.g. from the EIR or Project BIM Brief. For example, for the procurement strategy: Design Bid Build, Design and Construct, Integrated Project Delivery. If unknown, write ‘to be confirmed’. Highlight any amendments made after the issue of the EIR.
The procurement strategy will determine if a single or multiple BEPs are required and when/how the responsibility is handed over. If it involves the designer as part of the contractor engagement, the Design BEP and Construction BEP can be combined in one document.
Delivery team members
Contact details: The contact details of key stakeholders who will undertake the information management function on behalf of the delivery team are shown in the Delivery team members table.
Delivery team members table
AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.4.1 a) dot points 3 & 4 requires the lead appointed party to confirm the names of the individual(s) who will undertake the information management function within the delivery team.
This table is usually completed by the BIM Manager. Add or amend roles in the table as required. Add extra delivery team members as necessary when known.
As noted in clause 3.1.4 of the National BIM Guide, the AS ISO 19650 series never uses the term ‘Information Manager’ but instead always refers to an “individual or individuals nominated by the appointing party to undertake the information management function” for a project. This is typically the BIM Manager, but in instances where this is a dedicated role, add a separate row for ‘Information Manager’ and include their details.
Delivery team résumés: Refer to ANNEX A – DELIVERY TEAM ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, Delivery team members’ résumés for professional résumés of key delivery team members.
Generally only included in the pre-appointment BEP. See AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.3.2 a). Delete if already addressed.
Time allocation: Refer to ANNEX A – DELIVERY TEAM ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, Human resource allocation table for the proposed allocation of key delivery team members’ time to the project.
Generally only included in the pre-appointment BEP. See AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.3.2 a). Delete if already addressed.
Common data environment (CDE)
Provision of CDE:
A project CDE should have been established by the appointing party in conformance with AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.1.7. If this is the case, enter ‘By the appointing party’ at the prompt.
If the appointing party has not established a CDE, specify the proposed technical implementation requirements, management expectations and commercial arrangements regarding ownership and responsibilities during and after project delivery.
CDE access:
Provide a link to the CDE.
Instructions for using the CDE:
Provide a link to the CDE location for instructions.
BIM coordination facilities
Provision of BIM coordination facilities:
If BIM coordination facilities are required, specify which party/parties will be responsible for providing, maintaining and managing them, including furniture, fixtures and equipment.
BIM coordination facility requirements: Refer to TECHNICAL, BIM coordination facilities.
Project information delivery milestones
The estimated dates for major project milestones provided by the appointing party are shown in the Project schedule table.
Project schedule table
This table is for summarising key project dates. They should be based on those provided in the pre-appointment BEP, or those dates amended as agreed, so copy those here or edit the table to align with them. Make sure they do not conflict with anything documented elsewhere. If they are documented elsewhere, e.g. in a program, it is preferable to append it and/or cross reference it rather than use the table.
Amendments to EIR
EIR amendments: Amendments to EIR proposed by the delivery team are shown in the EIR amendments table.
EIR amendments table
Document proposed amendments to the appointing party’s EIR to address any issues or challenges arising from them, e.g. technical feasibility, capability and/or capacity limitations.
Another column ‘Reason for change’ can be added and details provided if this needs to be made explicit.
Amendments to the appointing party’s EIR during the project life cycle can change the scope of service previously agreed and documented and can have contractual implications. Consider the potential impact of any amendment.
Additional BIM uses
Additional uses: Additional BIM uses proposed by the delivery team are shown in the Additional BIM uses table. These are BIM uses not specified in the EIR but are proposed to improve project delivery and outcomes.
Additional BIM uses table
Use this table to identify BIM uses and deliverables that will be created in addition to the appointing party’s stated requirements. Use the Comments column to clearly differentiate any uses that will not be available to them, e.g. Delivery team use only.
Delivery team structure
Delivery team structure: Organisational relationships between task teams are summarised in the Task team organisational chart.
Task team organisational chart
Edit the hierarchy diagram to illustrate the project team’s organisational relationships. Enter task team details such as discipline, organisation name and the AS ISO 19650 series information management function in each box, e.g. Lead appointed party.
It is recommended that information management function descriptions are used, not contractual descriptions, as contractual relationships are best defined in the contract. Organisational relationships described in the BEP may then be referenced in the annexures of the contract as necessary.
Refer to Microsoft Word Help for guidance on editing the hierarchy diagram. Alternatively, replace it with a diagram created in a graphic authoring application, or use a spreadsheet.
Roles and responsibilities
Role descriptions: Refer to ANNEX A – DELIVERY TEAM ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES for descriptions of roles and responsibilities assigned to delivery team members.
This refers to general descriptions of responsibilities associated with roles, i.e. job descriptions. Responsibilities for specific information delivery tasks are documented in the following sections.
Deliverables
The appointing party’s EIR or Project BIM Brief should detail the deliverables required including the level of information need for each type of deliverable at each information delivery milestone.
Amendments to the deliverables specified in the EIR:
The lead appointed party may wish to add deliverables based on their own project information purposes when preparing their delivery team BEP. They can be documented here. If there are no amendments, delete the prompt.
Deliverables: Refer to ANNEX D – MASTER INFORMATION DELIVERY PLAN (MIDP) for details of the deliverables the lead appointed party will provide.
The MIDP lists all the project’s information deliverables and sets out when they will be delivered, by whom, and to what level of information need. It is compiled by the lead appointed party from the individual task information delivery plans (TIDP) provided by each task team.
Note: TIDPs are not included in the delivery team’s BEP. Only the MIDP is included as TIDPs are only relevant to appointments of appointed parties by the lead appointed party.
Deliverables formats
Formats: In conformance with the appointing party’s EIR.
Amendments to the formats specified in the EIR:
The lead appointed party may wish to add other formats based on their own project information purposes when preparing their delivery team BEP. They can be documented here.
If there are no amendments, delete the prompt.
Submission of hard copies: In conformance with the appointing party’s exchange information EIR.
Management – General information
Delivery team EIR delivery strategy
Approach to meeting EIR:
AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.4.1 d) requires the lead appointed party to update the delivery team’s information delivery strategy as required. Include a high-level statement about the proposed approach to meeting the appointing party’s EIR. It should provide a narrative that connects the following sections of the BEP in a meaningful way and demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate. Cross referencing relevant sections of the EIR with corresponding sections of the BEP can assist this.
The approach should have been outlined in the pre-appointment BEP. If this is the case, develop it further as necessary at this stage of the project.
Aspects of the strategy that can be outlined include:
The federation/information container breakdown structure adopted for collaboration purposes such as organising the Common Data Environment (CDE) and providing a framework for formatting responsibility matrices.
How information will be created and distributed between virtual 3D models and other locations such as documents and databases, e.g. will schedules be generated wholly or partially from data in the model? Crucially, where will duplication or overlap occur, and how will the risks associated with this be managed?
What schema will be used to structure information to facilitate its management and exchange between different applications and stakeholders.
For less complex projects, outlining the approach may not be required if it is adequately conveyed by the following clauses.
Objectives for the collaborative production of information:
List the delivery team’s objectives for the collaborative production of information.
These could include:
Ensure effective collaborative sharing and coordination of information through the implementation of procedures documented in the BEP.
Minimise duplications, omissions and contradictions in data through the implementation of quality control measures such as checking procedures documented in the BEP.
Identify the metrics that will be applied to measure success in meeting objectives, e.g. timeliness and reliability of delivery. This may include benchmarking against similar projects. A similar format to PROJECT DETAILS, Project goals table can be applied.
Cross reference objectives to any goals identified by the appointing party.
Federation strategy and information container breakdown structure
Federation strategy:
Include a brief explanation of how the information model is to be divided into one or more sets of information containers. Conceptual frameworks that can be used for this purpose include ones that are discipline-based, functional, spatial, geometrical, or combinations of them. The federation strategy is a statement of the general approach – the information container breakdown structure represents its implementation.
The information container breakdown structure for the project is summarised in the Information container breakdown structure diagram.
Information container breakdown structures set out how information containers are grouped together in a hierarchy. The breakdown structure usually informs the organisation of the High-level responsibility matrix, so is best completed before developing it.
The upper levels of the hierarchy are typically based on disciplines, but lower levels can be based on other criteria. Consider how the structure may need to be broken down further in the life cycle of the project and make provision for it.
Typical criteria for organising lower levels of the structure include:
Work package.
Work zone (including ones for design stages and/or construction stages).
Location, e.g. Building 2, Level 5 (coordinate with federation strategy).
Content type, e.g. design, project management or financial information.
Content format, e.g. models, drawings, documents, databases.
Security is another consideration that can shape the breakdown structure – decide the best way to segregate information for this purpose.
The upcoming National Annex to AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) includes fields for encoding the functional breakdown structure and spatial breakdown structure in the information container IDs managed in the Common Data Environment (CDE). Defining these breakdown structures first informs the development of codes that express the breakdown hierarchies.
Providing the project team with a clear picture of the breakdown structure facilitates the reliable storage and retrieval of information in the CDE. While the CDE organisation may be based on database management system rather than a file-based folder structure implied by the diagram, a diagram can still be an effective means of communicating the organisation of project information to the team.
Information container breakdown structure diagram
Information container ID: Refer to TECHNICAL, CDE data standard.
Detailed responsibility matrix
Refer AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.4.2.
Note that during appointment and confirmation of the delivery team’s BEP with each appointed party, AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.4.1 c) on the delivery team BEP only requires the High-level responsibility matrix to be updated by the lead appointed party; no more. The updated Detailed responsibility matrix is an intermediate step between the High-level responsibility matrix and the Task information delivery plans (TIDP) and Master information delivery plan (MIDP). It is not referenced as an appointment resource because the contractual requirements are fulfilled by the High-level responsibility matrix and the TIPD and MIDP.
Delivery team responsibilities: Refer to ANNEX B – DETAILED RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX, Detailed responsibility matrix for details of the level of information of model element/objects to be provided by the delivery team in response to the level of information need specified in the appointing party’s EIR.
Lead appointed party’s EIR
Lead appointed party’s EIR:
Refer AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.4.3. Document the lead appointed party’s EIR here including the following:
The level of information need for each information requirement. See Level of information need clause below.
The acceptance criteria for each information requirement.
The dates that each information need will be met relative to the project’s information delivery milestones.
The supporting information the lead appointed party might need to fully understand or evaluate each information requirement.
Master information delivery plan
Master information delivery plan (MIDP): Refer to ANNEX D – MASTER INFORMATION DELIVERY PLAN for details of information delivery by all task teams.
Refer AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clauses 5.4.4 and 5.4.5. A requirement to include all TIDP has not been included in this BEP Template as the lead appointed party is expected to aggregate and coordinate all of them in the MIDP.
Level of information need
Level of information need approach:
The key difference between the High-level responsibility matrix and the Detailed responsibility matrix which is developed after appointment is that the latter identifies the level of information need for the deliverables outlined in the former.
AS ISO 19650.1 (2019) introduced the concept of level of information need to define information requirements at different stages of a project more precisely. The concept is described in greater detail in EN 17412-1:2020 (and ISO/DIS 7817:2022) Building information modelling – Level of information need – Part 1: Concepts and principles. See Appendix D – Defining information requirements Section 6 for commentary on the subject. The concept of level of information need addresses some of the limitations of previous concepts such as level of development (LOD) which is largely confined to describing the geometrical development of individual model objects.
The level of information need concept embodies a range of metrics for specifying the required level of quality, quantity and granularity of information required for each of the three elements of the information model – models, documents (including drawings), and tabulated data – at each stage of the project.
Use the prompts below to describe how the information deliverables and their constituent elements will be developed.
Deliverables development:
The Detailed responsibility matrix is used to describe the level of information the delivery team will deliver in response to level of information need specified in the EIR. As a core component of the BEP, the matrix defines how the expected level of information of each object type/asset class will be progressively developed during the design and construction phases for incorporation into the information model.
Describe if and how ANNEX B – DETAILED RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX, Detailed responsibility matrix will be used to describe the level of information of each asset object and reference it here.
Spatial object information:
Note that the High-level responsibility matrix and Detailed responsibility matrix generally relate to the geometrical development of individual model objects rather than spatial objects. To describe the data content (properties/parameters) associated with model spatial objects, use ANNEX C – LEVEL OF INFORMATION, Spatial object information table. Describe if and how it will be used, and reference it here.
Asset object alphanumerical information:
Note that the High-level-responsibility matrix and Detailed responsibility matrix generally relate to the geometrical development of individual model objects rather than their data content (properties/parameters). Describe if and how ANNEX C – LEVEL OF INFORMATION, Asset object alphanumerical information table or Asset object shared properties responsibility matrix will be used to describe the level of alphanumeric information and reference them here.
Information quality assurance
Proposed quality assurance approach:
If quality assurance requirements have been documented in the EIR or Project BIM Brief, reference them and note any proposed amendments or additions here.
If requirements have not already been specified, describe the measures proposed for assuring the quality of information. Include measures relating to the CDE under CDE management.
Quality assurance standards: Conform to the standards documented in TECHNICAL, Standards and project reference information.
Model quality assurance: Refer to MANAGEMENT – 3D MODELLING, Model quality assurance.
Information security and privacy
Proposed information security measures:
If security and privacy requirements have been documented in the EIR or Project BIM Brief, reference them and note any proposed amendments or additions here. Reference the relevant sections of the appointing party’s security policies and strategies, security management plans and security breach/incident management plans if available.
If requirements have not already been specified, describe the measures proposed for assuring the security and privacy of information. Include measures relating to the Common Data Environment (CDE) under CDE management.
Include governance protocols and responsibilities. This includes but is not limited to technical measures, authorisation processes for access, levels of access, security classification of information, privacy and IP protection measures and procedures in the event of breaches.
AS ISO 19650.5 (2021) specifies the principles and requirements for security-minded information management. It addresses the steps required to create security strategies, security management plans, etc (but does not provide them ready-made).
CDE management
CDE standards and procedures:
If CDE management requirements have been documented in the EIR or Project BIM Brief, reference them and note any proposed amendments or additions here.
If requirements have not already been specified, describe the measures proposed for maintaining the security and integrity of the CDE. Include applicable standards, procedures and instructions in TECHNICAL, Standards and project reference information.
CDE technical implementation: Refer to TECHNICAL, CDE technical implementation.
Collaboration arrangements
The following clauses describe the collaboration and communication procedures for local and remote users to access and use BIM for decision making.
BIM coordination meetings
Requirement: Hold BIM coordination meetings as shown in the BIM coordination meetings schedule.
BIM coordination meetings schedule
The meetings in this table are specifically about BIM-related matters. Coordinate with other project meetings scheduled elsewhere and incorporate them in a consolidated schedule as required.
Meeting type: Add or delete meeting types as required.
Timing: e.g. 2 weeks after contract award, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, 1st Tuesday of each month. If required, this column can be subdivided into project phases to show different frequencies for each phase.
Location: e.g. online, at a specified address. If the physical address of a meeting is not known at the time, enter TBC.
Participants: e.g. Project Architect, Design BIM Manager. Indicate who will be chairing the meeting, if known, by inserting (Chair) after the role description.
More detailed information such as the date of the next meeting, its location, agenda, etc can all be organised through agreed project processes. See Penn State BIM Project Execution Planning Guide Chapter 6 for suggested agendas for the initial series of meetings.
3D coordination/clash resolution: Refer to ANNEX F – CLASH DETECTION.

Describe the proposed approach to communicating with groups such as occupants, asset users, neighbours and investors to enable their requirements to be taken into consideration.
Details can include:
Key stakeholder details including their names, organisation, position, roles, responsibilities and contact details.
Communication protocols including responsibilities for coordination, preferred communication methods, notification of meetings.
Meeting or workshop schedule including locations. Coordinate with other project meetings scheduled elsewhere and incorporate them in a consolidated schedule as required.
The use of BIM for visualisations, virtual reality, or augmented reality as a means of communicating design intent.
Which items are subject to user group and stakeholder influence, the level of influence and how it will be integrated into the design process.
Management – 3D Modelling
Project location and set-out
Surveyor responsibility: Establish a Model Geo-reference Point before modelling commences.
BIM Manager responsibility: Nominate a Master coordinates file, a single file which includes all the World and Local Set-out coordinates and location settings.
Master co-ordinates file name:
This file will serve as the source of the project coordinates and for sharing such information.
BIM Lead responsibilities: Align all models with the Model Geo-reference Point shown in the Model geographic location table.
A Model Geo-reference Point is a point used to associate locations in the model with those in the real world. It is a generic term for various terms used in different modelling applications, e.g. Project Base Point in Revit.
Model geographic location table
Site set-out point establishment: Define the Model Geo-reference Point’s position relative to a physical Survey Point marked on site. Select locations that can be preserved throughout the construction period.
It is possible the Model Geo-reference Point will be disturbed during construction but its position can be determined relative to the Survey Point.
Amendments to coordinates: Record any changes to the spatial coordination (coordinates) of the master coordinates file established at the beginning of the project. Record the changes and the name of the person responsible for implementing them in the project meeting minutes. Once the design coordinate system is agreed upon, convert any model(s) of existing buildings relevant to the project into the coordinate system used for each designed building.
The BIM Manager is generally responsible for implementing changes to the spatial coordinates.
Existing conditions modelling
Refer to NBG Appendix C, Clause 2.1. If existing conditions have not been modelled prior to tendering, or existing information needs to be updated, extended or enhanced, use the following prompt. If they have been adequately modelled, delete.
Methods for modelling existing conditions:
e.g. Modelling based on laser scanned point cloud information. Specify the Levels of Development (LOD) of Model Elements required. See BIMForum LOD Specification for definitions of LOD for a number of model elements. Reference guidelines and/or standards to be adopted, e.g. GSA BIM Guide 03, ASTM E57 3D file format (Refer ASTM E2807-11). Refer to the EIR or Project BIM Brief for details of the extent of existing conditions to be modelled, what is to be modelled and the level of detail required. If not already defined in the EIR or Project BIM Brief, define them here.
See National Guidelines for Digital Modelling clause 3.1.1 and BIM Project Execution Planning Guide Appendix B, Item 25.
Model quality assurance
Describe quality assurance/control procedures; retaining data integrity/accuracy in BIM; and integration approach with cost planning, construction staging/sequencing, Schedule of Accommodation (SoA), space planning including resulting 2D drawing and schedule outputs.
The following clauses outline the model and data quality assurance approach adopted for the project.
Model quality assurance measures
Strategy for establishing model quality control measures:
Describe the strategy for establishing model quality control measures including modelling standards, project templates and pre-exchange checking, approval and sign-off procedures. Consider how the Open BIM Object Standard (OBOS) and https://bim.natspec.org/documents/open-bim-object-standardthe NATSPEC BIM Properties Generator can be used for this. See https://bim.natspec.org/documents/open-bim-object-standardhttps://bim.natspec.org/documents/open-bim-object-standardhttps://bim.natspec.org/tools/properties-generator.www.propgen.bim.natspec.com.au/www.propgen.bim.natspec.com.au/
Modelling standards: Conform to the modelling standards included in TECHNICAL, Standards and project reference information.
Include any standards specified by the appointing party in the EIR or Project BIM Brief TECHNICAL section in TECHNICAL, Standards and project reference information of the BEP. Describe any additional standards required. Adopt existing industry standards where possible. Another option is to adopt standards developed by team member organisations.
Project object library
A project object library is an effective means of establishing modelling standards across a project by embedding them in model objects.
Library establishment strategy:
If it is agreed a project library is to be used, describe how it will be established and hosted, and who will be responsible.
Library management strategy:
Describe how content will be added, updated and managed to maintain object quality. Describe management responsibilities, access rights and permissions.
Model development and sharing
Model sharing protocols
Model sharing and federation protocol establishment:
Describe the strategy for establishing model sharing and federation protocols for the project which are to be included in TECHNICAL, Standards and project reference information.
Model revision management strategy:
Describe the procedures and methods including supporting revision management applications that will be used to manage revisions to models, e.g. red lining, CDE status codes and metadata.
Consider methods for alerting recipients to model amendments to reduce the risk of them being overlooked.
Model Description Document (MDD):
For simpler projects without revision management applications or sophisticated CDEs, a Model description document (MDD) can be used for model exchanges to describe the model’s purpose, any limitations on its use and any changes from previous editions.
If required, reference the location of the MDD Template, e.g. the project’s shared resources, and provide instructions on how and when it is to be used. An example of a MDD Template can be found in ANNEX E – MODEL DESCRIPTION DOCUMENT (MDD). If not required, delete the Prompt.
Model development: Refer to ANNEX B – DETAILED RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX.
Model development
Model development protocols:
Conform to project information standards, e.g. AIA Documents E203, G201, G202. It is preferable to reference existing standards or standards with agreed amendments than to include purpose-written text in this location.
See BIMForum LOD Specification for definitions of Levels of Development (LOD) for a number of model elements.
Describe how the Detailed responsibility matrix will be used.
3D coordination
Coordination strategy
Model coordination strategy:
Describe the overall approach to model coordination. A coordination strategy encompasses more than clash detection alone, e.g. agreeing general zones for services, structure and penetrations before detail design begins. Explain what you are trying to achieve at each stage in the process to advance the development of the design. “Resolve problems, not clashes”.
Describe clash detection procedures including the obligations of those involved, workflows to be used, timing, reporting processes and formats, status tracking (New, Active, Resolved, etc), resolution and sign-off. It is preferable to reference existing standards and formats for these processes, e.g. BIM Collaboration Format (BCF).
Refer to ANNEX F – CLASH DETECTION, Clash detection schedule which can be used to specify the order in which items are to be coordinated.
See National Guidelines for Digital Modelling clause 3.6 & Appendix 1 and BIM Project Execution Planning Guide Appendix B, Item 11.
Key model handovers
As-designed model handover
Clauses included in this section assumes an As-designed model including existing conditions will be provided. Existing conditions models include existing site topography, structures, services, buildings and temporary works. If non-BIM methods have been used to deliver the project during the design phase, describe how models are to be developed from available information.
Agree what As-designed model handovers will be required, e.g. to the construction team only, to the construction team and the appointing party as a ‘For Record’ or ‘As-Designed’ model at completion.
Strategy for migrating the model(s) used for design/documentation to those used for construction:
Outline procedures for migration, including handover and sign-off protocols. Identify those responsible. Address how this can be done effectively with minimum effort.
Note any amendments to the procedures described in the Design BIM Execution Plan.
Permissible uses of design models including existing conditions for construction:
Define the status of information in design models including existing conditions. Summarise what they can, and cannot, be relied on for during the construction phases of the project. Reference contract clauses if available, and as appropriate.
Acceptance of design models including existing conditions for construction:
If the permissible uses of design models including existing conditions have been defined, confirm their acceptance and have all parties using the models sign-off on them.
If the permissible uses of design models including existing conditions have not been defined, assess the models and define limitations of their use. Summarise what uses they can, and cannot, be relied on for during the construction phases of the project. Reference contract clauses if available, and as appropriate.
Agree any remedial measures needed to make them conform to the project’s modelling and quality standards.
As-built model handover
This clause is only applicable to construction or design and construction BEPs. Delete for design only BEPs.
Strategy for updating and coordinating changes during construction into the final as-built model deliverable files:
Describe who will be responsible and how the model is to be updated and coordinated. Outline procedures for capturing changes, incorporating them in the model and verifying their correctness, including sign-off protocols.
Permissible uses of as-built models:
Define the status of information in As-built Models. Summarise what it can, and cannot, be relied on for during the operational phases of the project, e.g. records only, facilities management. Reference contract clauses if available, and as appropriate.
Technical
Software
Project software: The buildingSMART IFC-compliant BIM applications to be used on the project are shown in the Software table.
AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clause 5.4.1 f) requires the lead appointed party to confirm the schedule of software, hardware and IT infrastructure the delivery team will use.
Software IFC version compatibility:
Specify the version of IFC that project software is required to be compatible with, e.g. IFC 2x3, IFC4 ADD2, IFC4 ADD2 TC1.
Software table
Software versions: Once software versions are agreed by the delivery team, the use of different versions is not permitted without further agreement by them.
Strategy for managing software updates:
Outline policies and procedures for managing software updates including the parties responsible.

BIM human resource allocation table
Annex B – Detailed responsibility matrix
Level of information
Collaborative model development: At each project milestone, Model Element Authors (MEA) are responsible for developing the Model Elements shown to the level of information (aka Level of Development (LOD)) shown in the Detailed responsibility matrix.
Following the appointment of the successful tenderer, the lead appointed party is expected to expand the High-level responsibility matrix into a Detailed responsibility matrix, including all model element types used by the project team, and allocate responsibility to individual task teams.
The Detailed responsibility matrix is an appropriate way of defining the level of information to be delivered by the project team in response to the level of information need specified in the EIR.
There are three broad methods for defining level of Information need:
Descriptive Method: Describing the level of Information need at one or more stages of the project lifecycle.
Industry Specification Method: Using the US BIMForum Level of Development (LOD 100 to 500) Specification (primarily for geometrical development) or the UK NBS BIM Toolkit Level of Model Definition (LOMD) system derived from the combined Level of Detail (LOD 1 to 5) and Level of Information (LOI 1 to 5).
Asset Definition Method: Defining the level of information need for each asset individually is the most complete method.
For an overview of model development and Levels of Development (LOD) of model elements see National Guidelines for Digital Modelling clauses 1.6 & 1.7. See also NATSPEC BIM Paper NBP 001: LOD and BIM for an explanation of LODs.
NOTE: This example of a Detailed responsibility matrix shows the most common content for these types of matrices: the level of geometrical information of Model Elements, generally referred to as LOD.
A similar format can be adopted for specifying responsibilities for other deliverables such as alphanumeric information, documents and drawings, and the required level of information at different stages for each. See EN 17412-1:2020 (and ISO/DIS 7817:2022) Building information modelling – Level of information need – Part 1: Concepts and principles for details.
ANNEX C – LEVEL OF INFORMATION includes a Spatial object information table, Asset object alphanumeric information table, and Asset object shared properties responsibility matrix for specifying the level of information for these other types of information. Adapt or develop responsibility matrixes to suit the needs of the project.
Legend for Detailed responsibility matrix
Two examples of detailed responsibility matrices are provided in this Template – USE ONLY ONE:
The Detailed responsibility matrix below which has a simplified list of model elements.
The Detailed responsibility matrix (UniFormat alternative) following it which organises model elements by UniFormat classification.
Note: If the High-level responsibility matrix in the pre-appointment BEP has been completed, transpose the MEA for each element at a given project phase to the relevant project milestone column in the Detailed responsibility matrix. See the Guidance before the High-level responsibility matrix which explains how they can be used together.
Using the Detailed responsibility matrix (these instructions also apply to the UniFormat alternative):
Determine the LOD required for each Model Element at each project milestone, and the MEA responsible for developing it to that LOD. Record these decisions by inserting the appropriate abbreviations from the Legend in the cells of the table. Refer to BIMForum LOD Specification for definitions of each LOD including authorised uses, model management protocols, responsibilities, etc. Any project-specific amendments to the definitions should be documented.
Modify the table to suit the requirements of the project. For example:
Edit Model Elements to suit the project. Those listed can be merged for simple projects, or another classification scheme substituted as required, e.g. Revit Family categories.
If more than one author will be developing an element, add additional rows and enter the LOD each will be responsible for.
If two authors are required to collaborate closely in the development of an element throughout the project, e.g. an architect and a structural engineer coordinating door and window openings in structural walls, indicate this by entering the abbreviations for both in the same MEA cell, e.g. AR + ST.
Edit the project milestones to suit the BEP type and scope of service being provided, e.g. for a Design BEP, include only milestones within that phase. More milestones can be included to show a finer gradation of element development but be aware of the additional effort this entails. Focus on the LODs required at key handover points at the end of major project phases and work backwards only to the extent necessary. Defining LODs during conceptual and schematic design phases may be futile.
Shading or colour coding of LODs, MEAs or project phases can assist legibility of the matrix and interpretation of information.

Annex C – Level of information
Spatial object information
Proposed information delivery: The Spatial object information table shows the proposed level of information for spatial objects to be delivered by the delivery team at each information delivery milestone in response to the appointing party’s EIR.
Note: A schedule of spaces/spatial objects has not been included in this template because spaces are usually documented elsewhere. Also, the properties required will usually apply to all spatial objects.
The Spatial object level of information need table in the EIR specifies the spatial object properties required at each information delivery milestone. It does not use a numerical scale or external metric to describe this because the level of information is implied by the properties included.
Spatial object information table
Instructions
Copy the properties from the Spatial object level of information need table in the EIR into this table. (It may be simpler to copy the whole table here, change the ‘Required at Milestone 1, 2, 3….’ headings to ‘Deliver at Milestone 1, 2, 3, ….’, and edit the checked or filled cells as required).
Add columns as required for each milestone listed in ANNEX D - MASTER INFORMATION DELIVERY PLAN, Master information delivery plan (MIDP).
Indicate the properties to be delivered by adding a tick, symbol or fill to the cells.
If preferred, N/A can be added to cells to make it clear an item will not be delivered.
This table specifies the properties applicable to ALL spatial objects. If different property sets are proposed for particular groups or classes of spatial objects, subdivide the table into the groups or classes and indicate the properties proposed for each.
Discipline
Indicate responsibilities for providing the required properties for spatial objects and entering values for them by entering the acronym for the relevant party from the following Key to disciplines.
Disciplines are shown as an example. Amend the descriptions and codes to suit the project. The two letter codes shown are from the upcoming National Annex to AS ISO 19650.2 (2019). A single letter code may be preferred for projects with a limited number of disciplines.
If responsibilities for properties have been documented already, review them before including them in this table to ensure there are no gaps, inconsistencies or contradictions.
Key to disciplines
Spatial information location:
Many spatial object properties/parameters – particularly geometrical ones – are automatically generated by the modelling application. However, not all properties in the Spatial object information table will be, and the model may not be the most appropriate location for every property, particularly those relevant to the operation and maintenance of the asset.
Use this prompt to describe where properties not included in spatial objects will be located, e.g. spreadsheet, database, and how it will be linked to the model, e.g. room number. This should be consistent with the approach to meeting EIR described under MANAGEMENT – INFORMATION IN GENERAL, Delivery team EIR delivery strategy.
Asset object alphanumeric information
Proposed information delivery: The Asset object alphanumeric information table shows the proposed alphanumeric information for asset objects to be delivered by the delivery team at each information delivery milestone in response to the appointing party’s EIR.
The asset object alphanumeric information to be provided can be documented by copying the Asset object alphanumeric level of information need table from the EIR to here and highlighting any amendments or additions.
If this is not available, two alternative tables for documenting level of information need are provided:
Asset object alphanumeric information table.
Asset object shared properties responsibility matrix.
Select one and amend the text above accordingly.
Purpose of the Asset object alphanumeric information table:
Use this table to show at which information delivery milestone alphanumeric information will be provided.
Use later clauses and tables for addressing the geometrical development of asset objects.
Asset object alphanumeric information table
Instructions
Copy the properties from the Asset object level of alphanumeric information need table in the EIR into this table. (It may be simpler to copy the whole table here, change the ‘Required at Milestone 1, 2, 3….’ headings to ‘Deliver at Milestone 1, 2, 3, ….’, and edit the checked or filled cells as required).
Add columns as required for each milestone listed in the ANNEX D - MASTER INFORMATION DELIVERY PLAN, Master information delivery plan (MIDP).
Indicate the properties to be delivered by adding a tick, symbol or fill to the cells.
If preferred, N/A can be added to cells to make it clear an item will not be delivered.
This table specifies the properties applicable to ALL asset objects. If different property sets are proposed for specific groups or classes of asset objects, e.g. architectural, mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, subdivide the table into the groups or classes and specify the properties for each.
Discipline
Indicate responsibilities for including the required properties in asset objects and entering values for them by entering the acronym for the relevant party from the following Key to disciplines.
Disciplines are shown as an example. Amend the descriptions and acronyms to suit the project. The two letter codes shown are from the upcoming National Annex to AS ISO 19650.2 (2019). A single letter code may be preferred for projects with a limited number of disciplines.
If responsibilities for properties have been documented already, review them before including them in this table to ensure there are no gaps, inconsistencies or contradictions.
Key to disciplines
The asset object alphanumeric information to be provided can be documented by copying the Asset object shared properties responsibility matrix from the EIR to here and highlighting any amendments or additions.
If this is not available, the table below can be used. Indicate the discipline responsible for adding properties to asset objects at each phase of a project by inserting a symbol or fill in the appropriate cell.
Add or delete phases in the header row as required. The discipline codes shown are examples only. Amend as required.
Asset object shared properties responsibility matrix
Instructions
Indicate responsibilities for including each property in asset objects by entering the acronym for the relevant party from the following Key to disciplines in the ‘Responsibility’ column. Disciplines are shown as an example. Amend the descriptions and acronyms to suit the project. The two letter codes shown are from the upcoming National Annex to AS ISO 19650.2 (2019). A single letter code may be preferred for projects with a limited number of disciplines.
Key to disciplines
Asset object alphanumeric information location:
Some asset object properties/parameters are automatically generated by the modelling application. However, not all properties in the Asset object alphanumeric information table or Asset object shared properties responsibility matrix will be, and the model may not be the most appropriate location for every property, particularly those relevant to the operation and maintenance of the asset.
Use this prompt to describe where properties not included in asset objects will be located, e.g. spreadsheet, database, and how it will be linked to the model, e.g. object ID or designation. This should be consistent with the approach to meeting EIR described under MANAGEMENT – INFORMATION IN GENERAL, Delivery team EIR delivery strategy.
Annex D – Master information delivery plan (MIDP)
Information deliverables
Responsibilities: Task teams are responsible for delivering information in the forms, at the levels of information need, and at project information delivery milestones shown in the Master information delivery plan (MIDP).
Refer to AS ISO 19650.2 (2019) clauses 5.4.4 and 5.4.5. The MIDP is compiled by the lead appointed party from the individual task information delivery plans (TIDP) provided by each task team. When using this or any other template, the TIPD should be the same format as the MIDP to aid compilation.
Note: TIDPs are only relevant to appointments of appointed parties by the lead appointed party, so are not included in the BEP.
Master information delivery plan (MIDP)
Annex E – Model Description Document (MDD)
MDD Template
If called up as a requirement under MANAGEMENT – 3D MODELLING, Model sharing protocols, use the Template below.
Description: A MDD is a document issued with a model to describe what it contains and identify any limitations of use.
Instructions:
Include details of how and when the MDD is to be used, e.g. included as a text file at specified types of model exchanges.
Model description document
Agreed model use: Edit as required, e.g.:
The model has been issued for:
Aiding coordination during the design process, e.g. noting the specific areas where coordination has been completed.
Confirming model elements have been created as specified in the BEP, unless otherwise agreed.
Providing an overall view of the project to supplement the information contained in the drawings and schedules.
A visualisation aid.
Assisting in the production of schedules of quantities.
Assisting in the production of shop or fabrication drawings.
An input to fabrication, manufacture and/or construction.
Annex F – Clash detection
Clash detection objectives
Process objective: The objective of the clash resolution process is to produce a federated model with minimal coordination issues at the completion of each project stage.
Clash detection responsibilities
Base model: It is the responsibility of the BIM Manager to provide a base model to all Discipline BIM Leads.
Discipline models: It is the responsibility of Discipline BIM Leads to develop all discipline models from the base model provided by the BIM Manager.
Model federation: It is the responsibility of the BIM Manager to organise the federation of discipline models for the purpose of coordination and clash detection.
Clash detection method: The delivery team are to use automated conflict checking/clash detection software during Schematic Design and onwards to identify and resolve geometric clashes within the 3D geometric environment.
Clash detection schedule: The BIM Manager is responsible for developing the Clash detection schedule for reference by all Discipline BIM Leads.
These responsibilities can be supplemented with accountabilities if these need to be made clear.
Clash detection meetings
3D coordination/clash detection meeting schedule: Refer to MANAGEMENT – INFORMATION IN GENERAL, BIM coordination meetings.
Design phases
Requirements:
Hold clash detection meetings regularly and at least fortnightly during the last half of Schematic Design and all of Design Development/Detailed Design.
The BIM Manager (and Model Managers where applicable) for each discipline are required to attend clash management meetings.
The Architect and BIM Manager will chair the meetings, “navigate” the federated model, and document the location and nature of identified issues.
The BIM Manager will assign responsibilities for resolving any BIM-related issues that cannot be resolved during the meeting.
The outcome sought from meetings is a clear understanding of any BIM-related issues, and the tasks required to rectify them.
Clash reports are to be issued to the delivery team and appointing party no later than the next working day after the meeting.
Construction phase
Responsibility: The Contractor is responsible for arranging clash detection meetings during the construction stages similar to those described for the design phases.
Clash detection schedule
Clash selection sets: Conduct clash detections between sets of elements in the order shown in the Clash detection schedule.
It may not be possible to define all clash detection sets in detail when drafting the pre-appointment BEP. If they cannot be defined in any meaningful way, postpone inclusion of clash detection schedules until a later revision.
Clash detection schedule
Using the Clash detection schedule:
Substitute the names of the pairs of discipline models to be coordinated for the headings ‘Discipline A’ and’ Discipline B’, e.g. ‘Structural’ and ‘Mechanical’. The abbreviations used for the MEA in the Detailed responsibility matrix can also be used for this purpose. Provide a legend for the abbreviations adjacent the schedules if considered necessary.
In each row under these headings enter descriptions of specific Model Elements within the discipline models that are to be checked for clashes, e.g. Beams, Supply air (ducts), All.
Copy the schedule for each Clash Set as required and renumber, e.g. Clash Set 2, Clash Ref. No. 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, etc.
The Clash Ref. No. can be cited in reports, or the Clash detection schedule can be used for reporting purposes by adding additional columns for results and comments.
Show completion dates for each Clash Set on the project program to place them in context and facilitate reference.
Clash detection rules
Describe modelling rules for clash detection purposes including hard clashes; construction tolerances; safe working/ maintenance zones and the items described in the following prompts.
Elements excluded from clash detection:
Describe elements excluded from the clash sets, and clashes to be supressed/ignored, e.g. power outlets in walls.
Elements attributes for clash detection:
Describe attributes attached to elements necessary to make clash rules work, e.g. penetrations in partitions, definition of clearance tolerances and service zones.
Clash tolerances
Clash tolerances by project stage:
Set minimum tolerances for clash detection for project stage deliverables. These tolerances may vary between stages, e.g. moving from a 100 mm tolerance at Schematic Design to a 25 mm during Design Development/Detailed Design.
This information may be better presented as a table showing the tolerances for different groups of elements at each stage.
Clash resolution priorities
Clash level categories: Clashes are organised into three levels for the purpose of assigning priorities for rectification or resolution.
Priority assignment: Delivery team members are to agree priorities for resolving geometric clashes between sets of elements prior to each clash detection meeting. These priorities will determine which sets of building elements should be included in the Clash detection schedule and in what order.
Clash resolution: Where clashes occur, give precedence to resolving those assigned the highest priority over those of lower priority.
Priorities for resolution in descending order:
Level One Clashes
Those that are considered critical to the design process. As Level One Clashes are those that are assigned the highest priority, they should be rectified within the model/s as soon as possible, and preferably prior to clash detection meetings.
Examples of the clash components in this category include, but are not limited to:
a)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. cable trays (electrical and communications)
b)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. hydraulic systems piping
c)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. pneumatic tube system
d)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. ceilings
e)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. fire and acoustic rated walls (for coordination of dampers and other mechanical equipment needs)
f)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. structure (columns, beams, framing, load bearing walls, etc.)
g)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. mechanical ductwork and piping (by individual system, e.g. supply air vs. return air)
h)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. equipment access clearances
i)	All equipment and their applicable clearances vs. walls
j)	All equipment and their applicable clearances vs. structure
k)	Mechanical equipment and fixtures vs. electrical equipment and fixtures
l)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. plumbing piping
Level Two Clashes
Those that are considered important to the design and construction process. These clashes should be rectified during project coordination meetings.
Examples of the clash components in this category include, but are not limited to:
a)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. fire sprinkler system piping
b)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. medical gas piping
c)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. electrical equipment, fixtures, and devices
d)	Mechanical ductwork and piping vs. floors
e)	Cable trays (electrical and communications) vs. pneumatic tube system
f)	Cable trays (electrical and communications) vs. hydraulic systems piping
g)	Cable trays (electrical and communications) vs. fire sprinkler system piping

Level Three Clashes
Those that while considered important to the correctness of the model, will generally be changing on a regular basis throughout the design and construction process. While these clashes are those that are assigned a lower priority, they should be rectified before the completion of the project stage deliverable and/or submission of the model/s to the appointing party.
Examples of the clash components in this category include, but are not limited to:
a)	Hydraulic piping vs. electrical equipment, fixtures, and devices
b)	Hydraulic piping vs. mechanical equipment, fixtures, and devices
c)	Joinery vs. walls and ceilings
d)	FFE vs. electrical fixtures and devices
e)	FFE vs. walls and ceilings
f)	Disability Discrimination Act 1992 clear space requirements vs. doors, fixtures, walls, structure
All Other Clashes
While the above clashes have been assigned priorities, other clashes will exist within models. These other clashes should not be ignored or discarded.
Clash detection reports
Clash detection reporting procedures:
Include details such as frequency of reporting, and the parties responsible for creating reports, reviewing, and approving them.
Clash report content: Document any outstanding coordination issues between delivery team members.
Clash detection report format:
Include items such as clash report templates and details such as report identification and file formats, e.g, excel, dashboarding.
Coordination confirmation: The delivery team is to provide a statement that it has addressed all clashes identified.
Clash detection colours
Requirement: Unless another system has been specified in the EIR or Project BIM Brief assign the colours shown in the Clash detection colour schedule to Model Elements in models being combined for clash detection:

Using the Queensland Health Project Information Requirements (PIR), this Design Building Information Modelling (BIM) Execution Plan (DBEP) template is to be populated in Microsoft Word by the tendering Delivery Team for the named project.
Track changes must be used to highlight any changes between the original document and all subsequent revisions. Once agreed by the Delivery Team and Queensland Health, accept changes and record a summary in the version history table on page 3.
The DBEP must outline the Delivery Team’s proposed approach to using BIM/s and information management practices for the design stages the Delivery Team are engaged to perform. Before the start of a new major stage (Schematic Design, Detailed Design, Construction Documentation, etc.) the DBEP shall be reviewed, revised and agreed with the Queensland Health Project Management, confirming the approach for that stage.
The design BIM/s will be used by other Appointed Parties such as the Quantity Surveyor (QS) for costing and Contractor to inform the tender and construction, ultimately the production of as-built BIM/s containing asset data for the project will be handed over to the Hospital and Health Service (HHS).
The Delivery Team is to use any of the following information sources to assist in the creation of this document:
Queensland Health Capital Infrastructure Requirements (CIR)
Queensland Health PIR for BIM
Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists
Queensland Health BIM Data Uploader Template
Any existing conditions HHS BIM/s
Existing 2D drawings, reports and schedules
Survey information including laser scans
HHS critical Asset Information Requirements (e.g. naming, coding, classifications)
Functional Design Brief and any space planning information
AusHFG codes and guidelines
The DBEP must be developed by the proposed BIM Manager, taking into consideration the needs of the Delivery Team and Queensland Health PIR and CIR. The DBEP will be used as part of the assessment criteria for determining a preferred Delivery Team for design stages.
The DBEP will always be created prior to the development of the Construction BEP (CBEP). The DBEP and federated model will be used by tendering Contractors to inform the development of the CBEP and construction BIM/s.
Document structure
The document is divided up into Commercial, Managerial and Technical sections in alignment with ISO 19650. The Managerial section is further split into the logical project delivery stages. In this way, Appointed Parties can work through the project delivery stages, understanding the specific BIM requirements for each discipline for the given stage.
This document articulates how information shall be structured, managed and delivered by each Appointed Party contracted by Queensland Health, in alignment with the PIR.
As changes during project delivery are inevitable, such as new Delivery Team members joining the project, the BEP shall be revised by the BIM Manager when any new Appointed Party joins the project and/or before each new project stage commences.

Project implementation – construction
See CBEP documentation.
Technical
The following section reflects the expected uses for BIM on the project, aligned to the PIR. Changing uses of BIM during the project changes the scope of service previously agreed/documented and has contractual implications. To reduce the risk of disputes, manage changes in conformance with the terms and conditions in agreements and contracts and keep a cumulative record of agreed changes in a constant location, e.g. the BEP. Each version of the BEP should highlight changes agreed since the issue of the previous version.
Software selection
PIR Section 2.3, 4.6, 4.8 - 4.10. Add other Delivery Team members and software as necessary.
The Delivery Team chosen (buildingSMART IFC certified) BIM authoring tools are recorded in Table 10. Once endorsed by the Delivery Team, use of different versions is not permitted without approval from the nominated Queensland Health representative.

Table : Model Exchange Frequency
IFC
At each project stage, beyond Schematic Design, discipline/trade BIM/s shall be provided to Queensland Health in both native and IFC formats. Native formats provide a method for future works and asset management and maintenance activities, however, IFC is the mandated openBIM format. All BIM/s shall be exported as buildingSMART IFC 2X3 format, however, there is a preference for IFC 4 if all BIM authoring tools on the project are both import and export compatible.
In addition to other project and BIM deliverables, a Federated IFC Model in IFC format is required at each project stage from DD onwards. All IFC models shall be exported from the BIM authoring tool with the custom Queensland Health parameters (refer to Section 6.5.4) mapped to the Queensland Health IFC User Defined Property Sets. This gathers all of the Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters conveniently together.
Table : Custom IFC user defined property sets
The mapping should also remove the QH_ prefix to all parameter names. The Property Sets retain their QH_ prefix. In future, a more integrated approach may be taken to better align Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters with native properties of the IFC schema.
Export settings (revit to IFC)
The below steps outline the process to deliver an IFC format BIM from Autodesk Revit. Other authoring tools should follow the same principles with regards to mapping Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters to custom IFC Property Sets as defined in Section 6.5.2.
Figure : Step 1 - Exporting IFC from Revit
In the relevant 3D export view in Revit (refer to Figure 1: Step 1 - Exporting IFC from Revit):
Select File
Select Export
Select IFC
Select Modify setup
Figure : Step 2 - Exporting IFC from Revit
In the Modify Setup dialogue box (refer to Figure 2):
Select the Property Sets tab, ensure relevant tick boxes are checked
Browse to and select the Queensland Health IFC Export Mapping file
Click OK and export as usual
Other settings may be adjusted as required but the result shall be all Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters being successfully mapped to the relevant QH custom Property Set tab in IFC (refer to Figure 3)
Figure : Example IFC showing QH_Asset Property Set tab
Data standards
PIR Section 2.4, 3.3, 4.1(c), 4.12 and 4.13. Appointed Parties to document the HHS asset data standards to be used e.g. floor/level naming, building, room name and numbering and asset coding.
The following asset data standards and HHS specific naming /coding requirements shall be used.
HHS building, floor/level and zoning naming
PIR Section 4.1(m). Appointed Parties shall use HHS coding. Engage with the relevant QH representative to obtain the necessary details, such as Functional Location Code values, level naming, etc., at the beginning of the project.
[enter here]
AusHFG room coding
Along with the nominated room naming and numbering schema, the AusHFG coding of rooms in BIM shall be used. This includes Room Code, Room Name, Room Description, Department, etc. Refer to Section 6.5.4 for required parameters and the Australasian Health Facilities Guidelines for further details.
BIM object coding
PIR Section 2.8, 2.9.2.1, 4.1 and 4.10. Appointed Parties to use QS and AusHFG coding.
Each Furniture, Fixture and Equipment (FF&E) model element must contain the AusHFG coding. The AusHFG model resource provides a free library of health facilities components for those organisations that are new to BIM. For more information see the Australasian Health Facilities Guidelines website.
All FF&E shall also contain the Group value (Group 1, 2 or 3) relating to the supplier/installer.
Uniclass classification
Queensland Health has recently implemented the Uniclass 2015 classification system. This is part of a phased implementation, with assets appearing on the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists initially requiring codes from the Systems (Ss) and Products (Pr) tables.
Where a Uniclass code has been supplied in the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists, it may be necessary to add another level of depth depending on the specific product or system being installed.
For example, an Air Handling Unit has a provided product code of Pr_60_65_03, however when specifying an AHU a more specific code may now be relevant, e.g. Pr_60_65_03_XX. This may also impact the provided System code. It is expected that all Uniclass codes are updated as necessary to match the most appropriate level as shown in Table 13.
Table : Uniclass 2015 code format
Further information about the implementation of Uniclass is presented in the Queensland Health Uniclass 2015 Guidelines.
Asset information requirements
The minimum AIR required by Health Capital Division are documented below in Section 6.5.4, however, various Computerised Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) may be used by each HHS, and their asset needs may vary.
The AIR is the minimum compulsory asset information deliverable. Consultation with the HHS Facilities Manager during early project design stages shall agree to the extent of additional AIR. Consideration of how critical information will be transposed between the PIM and the AIM shall be sought early in the project.
Collaboration with the HHS Facilities Manager will provide much of the needed Queensland Health defined project specifics, such as level naming, approved manufacturers, mandatory service providers, etc.
Functional location codes
The spatial location of all assets is important for Queensland Health to be able to successfully manage them. Functional Location Codes (FLC) are unique identifiers used for this purpose across all of Queensland Health. Refer to the Queensland Health Functional Location Standard or consult the Queensland Health PM for instruction on how to generate FLCs. See Figure 4 below for an extract showing a breakdown of the FLCs.
Figure : Functional Location Naming
Asset grouping
Queensland Health categorises assets into one of six asset groups. If any BIM object falls into one of these groups, it shall be treated as an asset and the relevant data shall be captured. For the relationships of these groups and their descriptions, refer to Figure 5 and the summaries below. This should be read in conjunction with Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists.
Building – asset data captured for the whole building/model (not against individual objects). Refer to Table 14: Parameters for Assets (Buildings and Spaces). All Building parameters should be mapped to the QH_Building user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcBuilding elements.
Spaces – asset data captured for each room/space. Refer to Table 14: Parameters for Assets (Buildings and Spaces). All Spaces (room) parameters should be mapped to the QH_Space user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcSpace elements.
Systems – asset data captured once for each system (not sub-components) on the provided Systems sheet of the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists only. Refer to Table 15: Parameters for Assets (System, Equipment, Miscellaneous). All System parameters should be mapped to the QH_System user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcSystem.
Major Equipment – asset data captured for each piece of equipment/plant on the provided Major Equipment sheet of the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists. Refer to Table 15: Parameters for Assets (System, Equipment, Miscellaneous). All equipment asset parameters should be mapped to the QH_Asset user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcElement.
Minor Equipment – asset data captured for each piece of equipment on the provided Minor Equipment sheet of Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists only. Refer to Table 15: Parameters for Assets (System, Equipment, Miscellaneous). All equipment asset parameters should be mapped to the QH_Asset user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcElement.
Miscellaneous – asset data captured for each item on the provided Miscellaneous sheet of the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists only. Refer to Table 15: Parameters for Assets (System, Equipment, Miscellaneous). All equipment asset parameters should be mapped to the QH_Asset user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcElement.
Figure : Queensland Health Asset Grouping
Queensland health asset equipment lists
Systems, Major Equipment, Minor Equipment and Miscellaneous assets are itemised in the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists, with assets listed under the relevant sheet for each group, as seen in Figure 6.
Figure : Example of the Equipment List
This Equipment List defines whether an item is treated as an asset - any item on these lists shall be considered an asset and the data relevant to the grouping shall be captured against the asset in BIM.
Asset data should only be entered once against each asset.
System data should only be entered once at the system level – not at the component level. Any item not on these lists does not require asset data.
However, this doesn’t mean other BIM requirements do not apply. For example, all model elements appearing in the AusHFG shall be populated with the relevant AusHFG code, Group number and FLC, etc, as specified elsewhere in this PIR.
Refer to the tables in the following sections for the specific asset parameters required for each asset group.
Asset attributes (BIM parameters)
The list of parameters used in BIM is detailed in this section. Queensland Health has prefixed all parameter names with QH_ as they relate directly to Queensland Health's needs. These parameters are available preconfigured for the project environment in Autodesk Revit 2021. It is understood that not all designers use this BIM authoring tool and it is hoped that future versions may provide preconfigured parameters for other applications if requested.
Schedules for each asset group have been provided in the Queensland Health Project Schedules (Revit)_2021.rvt file and should be copied into each model using the instructions contained in the file (refer to Figure 7).
Figure : Adding parameters and exporting asset schedules
Refer Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters.txt available from September 2022
Refer Queensland Health Project Schedules (Revit).rvt available from September 2022
If these documents aren’t compatible with selected BIM authoring tools, use the lists provided below to configure the parameters.
How to read the tables
The arrows under the abbreviated project stages columns indicate the direction of information flow at each project stage.
◄ Indicates information required from Queensland Health to enable the population of this field
► Indicates information being exchanged by the Delivery Team to Queensland Health
Where the Required? field is Mandatory, a value must be provided
Where the Required? field is Conditional, a value must be provided if one exists. (E.g. if a room has an AusHFG code it must be populated. If no AusHFG code exists for that room type then no value is required.)
Refer to the Queensland Health BIM Data Uploader Template.xlsx for data types and field constraints.
Refer to the PIR for additional information.
Building and space (room) parameters
Table : Parameters for Assets Buildings (BLD) and Spaces (SPC)
System and equipment parameters
Table : Parameters for Assets System (SYS), Major Equipment (MJR), Minor Equipment (MIN), Miscellaneous (MSC)
BIM data uploader
All populated asset data is to be exported at each project stage from Detailed Design onwards, as indicated with the arrows in the tables of Section 6.5.4, and provided to Queensland Health in the Queensland Health BIM Data Uploader Template.xlsx.
The data uploader from each discipline is to be consolidated into a single document by the Delivery Team BIM Manager prior to delivery at each project stage. There should only be one row per asset.
This data is used to ensure suitable testing and compliance checks can be undertaken throughout project delivery and that the final handover will be fully compatible with Queensland Health’s SAP and individual HHS needs.
The Queensland Health BIM Data Uploader Template.xlsx is structured to align with the asset grouping (refer to Section 6.5.2), with one sheet for each asset group. Only the relevant parameter columns are present on each sheet, meaning all cells should be populated for each row (except for non-applicable conditional values). This makes it easier for the Delivery Team to export schedules from their BIM authoring tool that are filtered and grouped by asset group type.
2 Documentation
PIR Section 2 (c). Appointed Parties to document any 2D documentation not derived from BIM e.g. typical details.
The following 2D documentation is not derived from BIM.
Table : 2D documentation external to BIM
Schedules
PIR Section 2 and 2 (c). Appointed Parties are to generate all schedules as extractions from the discipline/trade BIM/s and/or space planning tool. Any schedule not produced by these means must be documented here. The approach for coordinating these detached schedules with other information containers (BIM, space planning database etc) must be documented and approved by the Queensland Health representative prior to undertaking this work.
[list schedules not from BIM and detail the approach to coordinating these schedules with BIM here]
Room data sheets
PIR Section 3.4 and 3.6. Appointed Parties must nominate the approach for producing RDS for the project, as one element of the overall Project Information Model.
[enter approach to generating and coordinating RDS contents here]
Federated model and coordination
PIR Section 4.5. the Delivery Team is to document the approach to managing hard clashes; construction tolerances; safe working/maintenance zones; responsibilities and accountabilities; clash detection priorities; tolerance strategy; and outputs (e.g. coordination reports, dashboarding etc.)
General
The Delivery Team are to use automated conflict checking/clash detection software during Schematic Design onwards to determine geometric clashes in each discipline/trade BIM and then in the Federated Model. Once issues are identified, each discipline/trade shall resolve the model elements within the BIM/s they are responsible for.
The coordination issue identification and reporting should be held regularly (e.g. weekly or fortnightly) during the last half of Schematic Design and throughout Detailed Design and Construction Documentation. These reports should show any outstanding coordination issues between the Delivery Team members.
Queensland Health expects the coordination to be appropriate to the stage of the project (e.g. reducing coordination issues as the project progresses). Major space planning coordination issues between Architecture, Structure, Mechanical and other relevant services should be resolved by the end of Detailed Design. Construction coordination should be largely resolved by the end of Construction Documentation. 100% Design projects should be fully coordinated and constructable.
Tolerances
The Delivery Team must set minimum tolerances for clash detection for project stage deliverables. These tolerances may vary between stages for example moving from a 100mm tolerance at Schematic Design to a 25mm tolerance during Construction Documentation.
[enter tolerances here]
Clash tests
[All information required to undertake clash tests must be documented in the DBEP]
Consider which stage of the project various clash tests are most appropriate for, e.g. focussing on Architectural vs Structural earlier, before introducing services. All information required to undertake clash tests must be documented below.
[enter clash test strategy here]
All other clashes
While the above clashes have been assigned priorities, other clashes will exist within the BIM/s. These other clashes are not ignorable, nor should they be discarded. The intention is to have a Federated Model that has minimal coordination issues prior to completion of each project stage. There must be documented proof that the Delivery Team has addressed the coordination issues, where identified.
Co-ordination responsibilities
The Delivery Team BIM Manager facilitates the overall co-ordination and management of clashes during the design phases
The Services Consultants are responsible for discovering, managing and resolving clashes between services disciplines prior to the issue of discipline BIM/s to the BIM Manager for clash detection
Clash resolution meetings during design phases
Consider what outcomes are expected from clash meetings – are designers attending to resolve issues or are BIM coordinators attending to prioritise identified issues in the issue tracking software, etc. What is the approach to hosting productive clash meetings?
[enter the approach for clash resolution meetings here]
Clash detection meetings during construction phase
The Contractor is responsible for arranging similar clash detection meetings during the construction stages (see CBEP).

The BIM Timeline Table [BIM Timeline] (Appendix M) defines when all stakeholders should be exchanging and submitting their models to be used by the other consultants to coordinate and produce high quality drawings.
Model Production Delivery Table
The Model Production Delivery Table [MPDT] (Appendix D) represents a responsibility matrix for the various model elements as well as definitions for Level of Development (LOD) and Level of Information (LOI).
This matrix is essential to outline the following items:
How the project is broken down into model elements at each project phase
Which elements are to be modelled.
Who is responsible for modelling each element.
What the minimum LOD and LOI each element is to be modelled to
If and when the responsibility of elements change ownership
Each Model Element Author’s content is intended to be shared with subsequent Model Element Authors (MEA) and Model Users throughout the course of the Project. Abbreviations are inserted for each MEA identified in [MPDT] (Appendix D) such as “FOS – Architect,” or “KEP – Lead Engineer”. LODs must be adapted for the unique characteristics of each Project.
The LOD Specification defines and illustrates characteristics of model elements of different building systems at different Levels of Development. This clear articulation allows model authors to define what their models can be relied on for and allows downstream users to clearly understand the usability and the limitations of models they are receiving.
The Model Production Delivery Table information will be collated by the Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) once the contractors are onboard based on their Task Information Delivery Table TIDP. This will be an ongoing process and might be stretched during multiple design stages. The Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party), will start the collection of TIDP’s on Schematic Design Stage.
The Red Sea Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) will review and follow up with a BIM meeting with all Task Information Mangers to confirm and clarify assigned responsibilities of element/component production assigned and outline any scope gaps or discrepancies with each party, concerning their required output for delivery.
Upon agreement this will then form the part of the guidelines to adhere to for BIM for the project which all parties will have to comply to. As stated in all Scope of services agreements issued with contract appointments the BEP and Appendices form the basis of what is required to be delivered by all parties on the project.
Handover Deliverables
In the circumstances of a project handover from Signature Architect to Executive Architect, it is expected that all BIM information will be transferred. This will be centred around the latest BIM Execution Plan (BEP) which will outline the current state of development for the project. This along with related BIM documentation such as the Model Production Delivery Table (MPDT) and the Asset Information Requirements (AIR) will be handed over alongside any and all models required to continue the development of the project. If non-BIM models are required for certain design aspects such as complex geometry or site context, they must be included in any package.
At construction handover, the Client requires a complete Asset Information Model (AIM). Therefore, consultants on design stage and contractors on construction stage should work on an optimal way to make this happen.
The model will be revised as work packages are completed to record the as-built status of the works. The LOD for completed objects recorded as constructed by field staff will be updated to LOD 500 (Please refer to the [Model Production Delivery Table] (Appendix D) for more information).
The data structure which outlines requirements shall be further refined in the [AIR] to be developed following engagement with the Client FM team.
The importance of the interoperability and transfer of data that will be created for Handover to the Client shall be understood by all parties. The Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) will work closely with the Client in order to advise and ensure that the efficient transfer of data created integrates seamlessly with the desired FM system of choice by the Client.
Assets will be assessed with the intention of providing a list of proposed maintainable assets to the Client for discussion and agreement.
For a more detailed information on what should be delivered and when per project submission, please refer to [Master Information Delivery Plan (MIDT)] (Appendix J).
TECHNICAL MODELLING PROTOCOL
Modelling Methods
Model information shall take account of construction methodology. Elements are to be modelled in line with how they are typically constructed e.g. walls span from structural floor to structural soffit and curtain walling is assigned to the ground floor level spanning multiple floors unless modular construction applies.
Some model elements may be modelled by using model in Place method when required, to take advantage of references in the main model and the modelling tools in this method, in particular during early stages such a: Concept Design and Schematic Design. Any in-Place modeled must be added to the Exemption list and approved by TRSDC.
All model elements should only exist in a single model, by a single contributor so there is no duplication of the same information (e.g. only one contributor models any given floor at any given LOD). A special attention needs to be considered between the Architect (Signature & Executive) while interfacing with the Interior Design contractor. The core walls ownership will stay with the Architect while finishes will be owned by the Interior Design Team. Areas and Rooms ownership will always fall under Architect responsibility.
All design changes will be done in the source Information Model with relevant drawings re-exported and not as amendments to any exports (i.e. no changes to the 2D drawing). All model elements shall be created adhering to the boundaries of the project volumes where specified.
Rhino models may be used during the design development, but they will be converted into native Revit elements once the design progresses. If the Rhino models are required at the later design stages due to the complexity of the designed geometry, additional guidance and clarifications will be provides by the Rhino models authors to TRSDC and enlarge project team. Such scenarios will be highlighted as part of the BIM Exemption List. Any native Rhino/Grasshopper scripts will be provided as part of the sharing information. If specifics plug-ins or add-ins were used to aid with the interoperability process between Rhino and Revit, those will be documented and named within the BIM Exemption List.
The design review and approval process of 2D information derived from the models will be in accordance with the Design Management Procedure.
Each model contributors modelling obligations will be:
Contributors will concurrently develop the design and model as an iterative process.
Any element within a model which is illustrated on drawings will be derived from the model.
Contributors will use models as an explicit means to communicate design.
Contributors will ensure accuracy of the attribute data applied to elements.
Model Setup
The Units for the projects shall be defined in metric units set to millimeters with rounding to the nearest millimeter. If alternate units are required, then dimensions shall be modified and developed to reflect alternate unit values.
Angles to use the decimal degrees and to be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle. Annotations related to angles should also be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle.
E.G 20.57⁰
Setting-out annotations related to building geolocations Easting, Northing and Site Elevation coordinates to be round up to the nearest millimeter and to be in sync’ed with the overall project set-up coordinates please see Section 6.3 – Model Coordinates.
Orientation to True North to follow where possible the angles round-up to the fourth decimal after the full angle. In order to avoid any confusion generated by the Revit sensibility over the model’s locations, it is recommended that the building locations are acquired, published or transferred between different consultants’ models rather than manually input them. Annotating the angle to True North will be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle.
Model Coordinates
Model Coordinates should always be set to world coordinates, including (where known) the elevation. Project base points should be located to a Grid intersection, to the bottom left of the building (in project north), and survey point, should be located on a Project coordinate system ‘WGS 1984 UTM Zone 37N’ tile intersection to ensure accuracy or left at 0,0,0 for reference.
Coordinates are shown below for each type. Care should be taken to ensure that coordinates are clipped and pinned in place, to avoid them being moved. If a project base or survey points require moving, the original and proposed coordinates should be documented, and the design team made aware of this change.
All vertical levels are relative to Mean Sea level (MSL) at Jeddah. Another commonly used vertical datum at the site is LAT at Al-Wajh. Elevation (m MSL Jeddah) = Elevation (m LAT Al-Wajh) + 0.5954 m
Federation Strategy
Federation Strategy, also referred to as the Information Container Breakdown Structure will be used as a foundation for coordination. It will allocate volumes within the project to different disciplines into which they carry out their system model. The proposed overall modelling and coordination strategy for the project will enable concurrent work on models and will be developed based on numerous factors such as:
Required project deliverables
Overall project procurement strategy
Coordination requirements and consultant/trade package split
Unique project challenges and project BIM Uses
Model file size – Consideration to be made of model performance. Model file size to be kept in within manageable extents. It´s recommended to keep models file size bigger than 300 MB.
Capability of project team
Information Security
This will be further developed and updated as additional information and model authors are identified.
If trade contractors are unable to produce models for detailed design elements beyond the scope of the principle consultants, it shall be agreed between the relevant parties as to whether additional instructions are provided to the consultant to continue their design to an enhanced level or whether an independent modelling team are employed.
Volume/System parameters to be included if necessary, once reviewed with all the Task Information Mangers so that a common strategy that accommodate all consultants’ necessities is achieved.
All members of the supply chain are expected to review the table documenting volumes below and shall ensure that their models are developed in accordance with this strategy moving forward for the project.

Specialist Discipline Integration into BIM Environment.
This section of the BEP refers to the BIM Information that is produced by TRSDC Consultants that are not contractually appointed to produce BIM Models, but will provide valuable Design and BIM Information that will have to be embedded into other Consultants BIM Models. Such information can be described as reach metadata and will for part of the LOI’s requirements or might even influence the size, shape and orientation of the design elements consequently altering the LOD’s requirements.
To make sure that this information is captured within the exchange BIM model deliverables, it is crucial that a Specialist Discipline Integration into BIM Environment matrix is established so that every consultant understands what information is provided, when it is provided and by whom.
Responsibilities
Specialist Discipline (No BIM Modelling Scope) Responsibilities.
To read and familiarize with the BEP and any other documentation related to overall project BIM Scope of Works
To provide the information that will have to be embedded into other Consultant BIM Models as a clear format that is easy to understand, process and integrate and it is following the Master Information Delivery Table (MPDT) format
To provide regular updates to all the Consultants with BIM Modelling Scope when new information is produced, or existing information has been altered.
To actively participate in BIM Weekly Meetings to make sure that relevant information is being captured
Specialist Discipline (No BIM Modelling Scope) Responsibilities.
Provide feedback to Specialist Discipline regarding the format expected of the information required to be embedded
Incorporate the Specialist Discipline information following the Master Information Delivery Table MPDT matrix
Specialist Discipline Integration Matrix
File Naming Conventions
Also referred to as the Information Container Identification, the BIM project naming conventions will follow the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual. This file naming system is to be used for drawings and models only and should be used as the drawing/model name and within the title block for drawings.
Project Number
An alphanumeric code that is used by the project team to identify the project. The Program Code + Asset (Project) & Contract Code make up the Project Number.
Originator Code
An alphabetic code that represents the company responsible for that aspect of the work. The codes must represent the company name, and not the discipline.
Volume/ System
Two alphanumeric characters that relate to spatial sub-division of the project starting with Volume or System; ZZ is applied when all volumes are referred to.
Building Levels
2 alphanumeric characters that relate to Levels and Locations and is made up of two characters. This should align with the agreed project nomenclature outlined in Section 6.6 below. A guide to those codes as well as standard non-floor level codes is as follows in the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Document Type
A three-character alphanumeric code that indicates the type of information held within the information container.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Discipline / Role
The is a two-character indicating the discipline. Refer to the Red Sea Project Document Management System in the PMIS Manual and to [Drawing Series Numbers] (Appendix O).
Series Number
This is a unique 5-character code. The first two characters of the number should be used to signify an ‘element code’ that further classifies the file. One classification code system should be chosen and consistently used by all project teams. This number should always be used sequentially with leading zeroes.
i.e. Package Series (10XXX), multi-use number i.e. zone or building number (XX4XX) and the drawing number (XXX01)
Refer to the Refer to the Red Sea Document Management System in the PMIS Manual and to [Drawing Series Numbers] (Appendix O).
Additional Information for Submissions
Additional information parameters and their values shall be added to each sheet/title block when uploading or submitting on Aconex. The Contract/Work Package code and Revision number should not be included in the drawing or models name but should be stated for data entries on Aconex upload only.
Contract/Work Package
An alphabetic code that represents the work package.
Document Revision
An alphabetic code that represents the revision of the drawing at each Project Stage.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Level / Location Naming
A two-character alphanumeric code that represents the level or story of the building.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Rooms & Doors Naming Convention & Codes
Rooms naming convention should follow the design brief requirements and should be clearly identifiable. Rooms Codes should allow for unique rooms identification.
Doors codes provides every door in the building with an identification, which is further referred to in the door and ironmongery schedule. Doors are named after the room they are leading into. If more doors are present in the same room the ending number within the door code will receive and incremental number.
Revit Views Naming Convention
Revit views are to be named in a consistent way using clear, descriptive naming protocol following the “Camel Case” syntax. This is applicable to all Plan, Sections, Elevations, Schedules and Legend Views.
Prior to publish the models to BIM360, a Publish Set should be created and including 3D views:
Worksets
Worksets should be named in a consistent and logical manner to aid navigation in the project browser. Workset organization should be carefully considered to provide the most efficient working environment for the Design Teams.
Worksets are named with a role code, optional zone code and a description of the content.
Discipline - Identifies the owner of the object – Element author.
Zone - Once Zones are defined, worksets can used this optional field to define zone specific worksets
Content - Content is a description of the use of the workset. E.g. Interior (internal wall systems, doors, ceilings, rooms etc.), cladding or furniture. If a project is split by zone or function only the content code can be omitted.
Note:
Shared Levels and Grids Worksets
The Shared Levels and Grids worksets do not include the role code and is named Shared Levels and Grids as the default workset created in Revit. This is to enable all Design Disciplines to turn off all grids and levels from models linked in the sheet model(s). The grids and levels in the sheet model however will be placed in a workset with the role code. E.g. A-Shared Levels and Grids would be in the architectural sheet models
Each Linked Revit File will be placed in its own Workset following the naming convention below:
List of Worksets per Discipline:
- SIGNATURE ARCHITECT
- EXECUTIVE ARCHITECT (KAA)
- Kitchen & Laundry consultant
- Lead Engineer Consultant
- Landscape consultant
Landscape Worksets – Working Models
Landscape Worksets – Amenities Container
Landscape Worksets – Villas Container
Landscape Worksets – Clusters Container
- Interior Design Consultant
SPA CONSULTANT
Shared Parameters
A set of Master Shared Parameters that incorporates the client requirements will be distributed consistently across all design disciplines by the Lead Appointed Party [Master Shared Parameters] (Appendix G). Any amendments involving shared parameters that form part of the master shared parameters core will require approval from the Appointing Party and Lead Appointed Party.
For scenarios where design decisions are not yet finalized and multiple inputs may still be valid, the TRSDC Parameters will be filled in with all the current options listing first the Primary Option. For areas where the design has not yet progress that far to achieve a valid input the TRSDC Shared Parameters will be filled with TBC. At the handover stage the TRSDC Shared Parameters will be curated and will go through a final QA/QC that will only leave the Primary Option input.
E.G.
TRSDC_Material = Material_1 (Primary), Material_2, Material_3...etc
TRSDC_Material = TBC
All other Shared Parameters required at a discipline level will fall under each Appointed Party responsibility and all shared parameters files should be saved on BIM360 under the folder:
02_SHARED>XX>12_IM-Information Management>02_Supporting Files & Templates>02_Master Shared Parameters
Object Naming Convention
Model objects are to be named using clear, descriptive object naming for all object and family types prefixed by role or company reference. A list of object and family type codes are to be provided by each model contributor.
Where alternative object naming conventions have been used, these shall be detailed to the Project BIM Manager and TRSDC. Room naming shall be in accordance with the [EIR] if there is a room naming schema in place.
Best Practice
To get consistent results when searching for content, follow the specific rules set below:
All names should be in English
Use full words when possible
Names should be composed using characters A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9
Name should use CamelCase (no spaces, and capital words) unless otherwise noted in the following chapters
The following characters should not be used in any naming conventions:
,. ! “ £ $ % ^ & * ( ) { }[ ] + = < > ? | \ / @ ’ ~ #¬ ` ‘
Family Naming Convention
Family Full Name including all Family Types shall be limited to a maximum of 50 characters.
The name should use the underscore ”_” character as the delimiter between fields. The reason for this is that some programmatic scripts may interact with the hyphen.
Family files (.rfa) shall be named beginning with: <Role>_<Type>_<Subtype/Product>_<Descriptor1>
Role
Identifies the owner of the object – Library author.
Type
This field is the first level of specialisation. In other words, this is the highest level of family information in terms of purpose. This field should not be confused with the Revit Family Categories, although sometimes it might coincide (every object or family in Revit needs a category to define the object behavior and template).
For example, a door or a window family has a “Type” field that coincides with the Category but a table or a sink does not coincide. A table belongs to the Furniture category, the sink belongs to the Plumbing Fixtures category.
For example:
A_Door
A_Wall
A_Window
Subtype / Product
The Subtype / Product field forms the next logical level of information that distinguishes a family type from another.
For example:
A_Door_Sliding,
A_Door_Revolving
They are both doors but the subtype helps to differentiate between them. This field shouldn’t contain manufacturers.
If a new Subtype / Product needs to be created please discuss in the Information Management Meetings.
Descriptor 1
Optional - Brief User Description. The Descriptor 1 field is used to convey additional specialization information. It will help differentiate between subtypes.
For example:
A_Door_Sliding_GlassOpaque
A_Door_Sliding_GlassClear
A_Door_Sliding_GlassTempered
All families are sliding doors but the descriptor helps differentiate between them.
In the case of system families: Walls, Floors, Ceilings and Roofs Descriptor1 is the overall thickness.
For example:
A_Wall_Int_75mm
Type Naming Convention
All Revit Families should have at least 1 type. If this is not done, then the Family type name will inherit the family name when loaded into project.
If there is only one type don’t leave the field blank. Use ‘Type 1’
Indicate sizing in mm (fractional inches in case of Imperial) for Family components
Use Camel Case with spaces
Avoid repeating information already in the family name
Try using full words if possible; if needed, use abbreviations only from section 8 (Foster + Partners Abbreviations list)
All names must be in English
For example:
Family: A_Furniture_Chair
Family Type : Type 1
Chair Barcelona
Family: A_Casework_Suspended_SatinGloss
Family Type : 900 x 1500 x 300
As a best practice always use this syntax:
Width x Depth x Height
Family: A_Furniture_Table_Conference
Family Type : 900 x 1500
As a best practice always use this syntax:
Width x Length
Miscellaneous Revit Content Naming Convention
Groups and Assemblies
Groups should never be named with the default Revit naming convention Group 1, Group 2, etc as that is non-descriptive. Groups should never be used for a single instance, a common descriptor is a good starting point.
If it is the purpose of the group or assembly is to be able to move and select several elements again later use selection sets instead of groups or assemblies.
Scope Boxes
Scope boxes should be named in a logical manner for other team members to be able to use and find. There is no naming convention for scope boxes, but please follow these general guidelines:
Scope boxes should not be named according to packages, as the same scope box might very well be applicable for several drawing packages
Scale and location are good codes for their names
Scope boxes for GA drawings should use scale and the sheet number corresponding to the sheet their views are placed in
Document Numbering
Document Numbering Convention should be following the Red Sea Project Document Management System in the PMIS Manual. Drawings will be including a Volume/System Series related with the Island Wide (for Landscape, Civils, Marine) and another Volume/System Series related with the Asset.
Island Wide
Volume/System Series should be always the top left intersection grids following the grid system shared by TRSDC. Depending of the scale, the scope boxes should start from the top left to right.
EX.: Two set of drawings at scale 1:100 (purple rectangles)
Assets
Volume/System Series should follow the asset series. It there is more than one asset in the same drawing, the lowest Volume System Serie should be used.
EX: R08-HE1D01-FOS-13-00-DWG-AR-10100
Accuracy and Dimensions
No alterations/amendments to dimensions should ever be made when 2D drawings are extracted from the 3D models. The 2D drawings will form the contractual design information and so all dimensions for setting out is to be taken from them. By altering dimensions, the 3D models can no longer be used for reliable coordination reviews.
Annotation Methods
A strategy should be followed based on the methods listed below:
Method 1 – Container file Strategy
Method 2 – Multi file sheet production Strategy
Method 3 – By Linked View Strategy
Annotation Tags
The following table identifies which parameters and methods are used per each consultant to tag the model elements.
The following table must be filled with which parameters have been used in the annotation tags.
Drawing Scales
All drawings must be rendered and presented at one of several approved scales, which are typically defined by the ‘Task Team Manager’. All drawings created from model geometry must be presented at a scale showing appropriate detail. If the model is too large to be published at the agreed scale it should be subdivided over several sheets with reference to continuation sheets on the title block. Scales other than those approved should not be used. All model files/geometry must be created at 1:1 real world size.
Any Schematic/Diagrams will not have any scale assigned
The following table has been filled out indicatively. Please refer to the Design Management section of the Project Execution Plan and omit or amend sections to follow project requirements. Please remove this text following any changes.
TECHNICAL DATA PROTOCOL
The Task Information Manger (Appointed Party) will provide the model data requirements and responsibilities for each data contributor.
Guidance on data entry and shared parameters will be provided where required. Consultants are asked to supply details of their data entry and in-house data checking procedures to the rest of the BIM team for transparency.
On the agreed dates, all parties will submit their 3D Models and/or associated data drops, which will be coordinated by the Task Information Manger (Appointed Party). All data drops are to be fully checked and the information verified before issue.
BIM Weekly (bi-weekly DWFx) Information Exchange
This exercise represents the WIP information exchange between consultants meant to help the design process.
Native discipline-based 3D model files product specific for all design and analysis models (RVT)
Prior to publishing the models to BIM360 for creating a Design Collaboration Package Exchange, a Publish Set should be created and including 2D/3D views:
BIM360-3DView-Architectural Elements – 3D view with Consultant design intent which is not yet designed/handed over by/to the consultant responsible for it
BIM360-3DView-Export – 3D view only with Consultant´s elements visible which is under the scope. Tis view should be used to export the model to other BIM models formats: IFC, NWC and DWFx;
BIM360-3DView-Federated Model – 3D View with all consultant’s elements visible.
A 2D view Floor Plan for every different building level.
Naming conventions to be followed “XXX “- 2D View - Floor Plan “Description”
e.g. FOS - 2D View - Floor Plan Ground Floor

IFC 2x3
Notes:
IFC 2x3. BIM Authoring Consultants cannot ensure the translation of the digital process to extract the information from the Revit model to IFC. The Revit file information prevails
Native file formats and IFC formats are required with each model upload. Native file formats are to be referred to if discrepancies arise from IFC outputs. Correct mapping options to be selected for IFC exports refer to Section 7.3 for guidance.
Drawings
2D drawing files in dwg format cut from the submitted models

This section is reserved for the upload of documents such as BEP’s, Project Stage Reports, Area Comparisons…etc. File formats can be (PDF, Excel, Word…etc)Project File Format Overview
Project Task Teams File Format Exchanges
All base models (models containing the geometry) will be shared with TRSDC and project teams on a regular basis via the allocated space on the employer’s selected PMIS for the Red Sea Project.
The agreed model and drawing formats required for the data drops according with the information exchange schedules from Chapter 7 are:
<For Revit Based projects, all disciplines MUST use the same version of Autodesk Revit>
All file format exchanges must be agreed between parties at the beginning of the project and any further BIM workshops when new supply chain members are appointed. It must be adhered to throughout the life of the project. Deviations must only be made when exporting for Navisworks clash detection. File format will then be NWC, or for different platform collaboration, the use of IFC files is compulsory.
Technological advances and software are being reviewed to allow federated models to be hosted and viewed for a more ‘up-to-date’ collaboration workflow.
IFC Guidance
To ensure effective collaboration between the multiple parties a series of trail/test IFC (International Foundation Class) exports will be scheduled. The export shall contain IFC objects for all discipline specific objects to be produced by each respective BIM author.
IFC File Export Settings
Following a successful IFC exchange trial each BIM author must specify their IFC export settings. These settings should be shared under Appendix P – BIM Guides.
Data Reviews
Data entry will be an ongoing process throughout the project, it will be carefully controlled with regular in-house data checks carried out by each discipline. Checks to include;
Project data parameters have been correctly input. As a minimum the following information shall be contained within the model:
Family correctly assigned.
Type
Level
Ref. to the type specific data in the Specification if that data is not otherwise embedded
Any other information specified in the Model Production Delivery Table
Organization contact details are correct and up to date
No data amendments once extracted from the 3D models
Data has been entered in the correct fields and format (e.g. alphanumeric)
Data has been entered at the correct type/instance level
Model and project protocols have been followed (naming conventions, levels etc.)
Duplicate objects removed from the models
The responsibility for correct data lies with the model in the same way as the responsibility for providing the correct geometry. However, the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) will conduct periodic data audits and issue reports documenting the results.
PROJECT WORKSHARING & COLLABORATION
Collaboration is vital to the success of a BIM Project. There are two aspects to collaboration; communication between people (under Meetings in Section 8.6), and the control and sharing of the project information and data described in the following sections.
Model Collaboration
As part of BIM, the design shall be authored using BIM software collaboratively and in real time. Where work is performed in multiple offices or where subcontractors and suppliers are major participants in the BIM, the Consultants will facilitate the maximize “live” collaboration practicably possible and minimize the frequency and time lag of BIM updates to the Consultant’s master BIM from external participants. The BIM shall not be created at the end of the project only to meet project deliverables.
The Model Collaboration process will utilize the Autodesk BIM 360 platform – Design Collaboration module.
The Model Collaboration process will utilize the Autodesk BIM 360 platform – Design Collaboration module. It should follow the Appendix M – BIM Timeline.
BIM360 Package Exchange
The Work in Progress models should be shared by using BIM360 platform – Design Collaboration module. For a better understanding of the package exchanged, a naming convention should be used based in the following table:
Program & Project Code
This is a six-character indicating the Program Code and the Project Code.
Originator Code
An alphabetic code that represents the company responsible for that aspect of the work. The codes must represent the company name, and not the discipline – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Discipline / Role
This a two-character indicating the discipline. Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Package Exchange Code
The Package Exchange Code utilize the ISO 19650 Suitability Code (extracted from BS1192:2007+A2:2016), to define the status of the shared documents and Models between stakeholders.
Volume Code
Two alphanumeric characters that relate to spatial sub-division of the project starting with Volume or System; ZZ is applied when all volumes are referred to – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Sequence Number
Four digits sequential number – leading zeros should be used.
Common Data Environment & PMIS
The Common Data Environment is the working environment where all current, controlled project design information is stored and made available by controlled access. It is normally an application or group of applications that form the “single source of truth” for the building information.
A Common Data Environment (CDE) approach allows information to be shared effectively between all members of the project team; giving early access to information and avoiding risk of duplication. For this project Aconex and BIM 360 shall be the designated CDE’s.
BIM 360 will be utilized for all design related information which includes model uploads, PDFs and native design files. The following 3D views are required to be published on BIM 360:
One that contains only the discipline elements
Second that contains the federated model
Third that is tailored for export purposes that free of elements duplication between various design disciplines.
Aconex for other documentation such as word documents can be used as a check but formats unrelated to modelled information.
There are four main environments:
WIP (Work in Progress) – CDE
The working area within an organization’s own systems.
SHARED – CDE
The models that are regularly shared for use of entire project team. The Executive Architect will federate all models and the Task Information Manager contact from each organization will ensure all the latest relevant models are downloaded and federated into their WIP files.
All team members should be using other parties’ information for their own internal coordination checks. To progress to the next stage the information must be authorized by the appropriate person.
PUBLISHED – TRSDC PMIS
This information will have been accepted by the nominated party, in which case it will be suitable for tender or construction (2D model output only)
ARCHIVE – TRSDC PMIS
History of project information stored within the CDE.
Please refer to the BIM 360 User Guides and PMIS Manual for more information on folder structures and interaction with the systems.
Model Upload Process
3D models must be shared at regular intervals to ensure the rest of the project team are coordinating with the latest information. This should happen following TRSDC BIM360 set-up environment.
BIM Models Exchange
Depending on which BIM Model format, the process of exchanging the information across all teams is different.
Revit Models Exchange
All native models should be exchanged using the Collaboration Pro module in BIM360 on a weekly basis. A proper naming convention should be followed – please refer to sub-topic 8.1.1 BIM360 Package Exchange. All consultants should be adding a description informing the major changes.
As the Interior Design consultants doesn´t have access to the Collaboration Pro module, Revit models must be exchanged manually. By having the models workshared in the work in progress folder – 01_WIP – all models should be copied into the folder by using the BIM360 feature: 02_SHARED>Asset folder>Discipline folder. Along with the Exchange, a communication should be sent out to all consultants informing the major changes.
All consultants should access to the 02_SHARED>Asset folder>Discipline folder and do a copy of the models into the Consumed folder: 01_WIP>Discipline folder>Consumed>HW3_06_ID-Interior Design – this folder should be created manually.
NWC and NWD Models Exchange
All Revit models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides – and uploaded manually into a folder in BIM360 located at: 03_SUBMISSIONS>01_OnGoing Design Coordination>12_IM-Information Management>Asset folder>weekly folder>NWC>Discipline folder.
DWFx Models Exchange
All DWF models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides – and uploaded manually into a folder located at: 03_SUBMISSIONS>01_OnGoing Design Coordination>12_IM-Information Management>Asset folder>weekly folder>NWFx>Discipline folder.
It´s required that the DWFx models contains 70% of the Omniclass codes included – please refer to APPENDIX J – Master Information Delivery Plan.
IFC Models Exchange
All IFC models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides. These models are only required to be exchanged on a gate submission and should be followed the workflow in place for the submissions.
BIM Models should be shared according to the table below:
Software Usage
The following list only includes the software that is required to be compatible with the Client’s systems and will form part of the deliverables. These file formats will form the basis of coordination between all disciplines. All other software required for the project, including version, shall be agreed by each discipline in coordination with all parties. The versions are those agreed at project inception. Upgrades to subsequent versions of the software after commencement of the project shall be subject to agreement by TRSDC, in which case will occur at an agreed designated stage of the project and documented accordingly in this section.
<For Revit Based projects, all disciplines MUST use the same version of Autodesk Revit, outlined above. For software updates, all parties must agree for upgrade. Software type can be determined by the EIR’s >
Clash Rendition Viewer
The clash rendition viewer to be used across the whole project.
BIM Meetings
A BIM Kick-off meeting will be held with all known supply chain members in order to run through the BIM deliverables for the project. This will directly reference the EIR and the processes for delivering BIM for the project. This meeting will be chaired by the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) and Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) who will attend all related team meetings.
This will then be followed by a meeting with all Task Information Managers from all project teams to go through the first draft of the BEP in a collaborative round table discussion and with agreement from all by its conclusion.
Moving forward; regular BIM meetings summarized below will commence with all Task Information Managers present from all relevant project team organizations. If not feasible for members of the project team to attend, then it is the team member’s responsibility to ensure arrangements are made for their members to still be in attendance through communication means.
The BIM related meeting plan will be developed by the Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) and the Interface Manager. The Design Coordination meeting frequency will vary through the contract period but in general will follow a weekly review or upon request for each of the Design Managers.
Summary of Meetings:
Clash Detection and Coordination Meetings Schedule
The Clash Detection and Coordination Meetings will take place on a biweekly basis or as per client request. In order for this to happen there are several tasks that are required to be completed by each design consultant. The actual days will be confirmed, but the following cycle is intended to be followed.
Outlined below is the fortnightly plan of actions. This will be updated once the design coordination meeting schedule has been agreed.
MODEL REVIEWS
Quality Control Procedures
Model audits are to be carried out regularly on the shared models for their compliance with this [BEP]. The process involves a combination of checks listed below to ensure there are no unresolved issues during construction or any significant loss of data upon transfer of as-built models and record documents at facility handover.
Clash Detection Process Overview
Automated clash detection is to be viewed as the last line of defense – it is always preferable to avoid unmanaged clashes through considered modelling than to rely on clash detection to identify and then resolve them.
Each BIM participant is responsible to maintain the integrity of the models and information and check/review these with their team manager as part of standard model collaboration before issuing to the SHARED part of the CDE.
If a clash is detected, according to the LOD per stage, that cannot be resolved by the construction, consultant and subcontracting team then the lead designer shall be involved in the discussion to reach an agreed solution. Individual subcontractors and consultants are responsible for making changes to their own model(s) only, and where/if required.
Automated clash detection of single discipline models is to be carried out by Task Team Information Managers at all project stages on a >specify frequency< basis using Navisworks Manage or similar software, by implementing the clash rules defined in >insert doc reference<. This is to ensure that coordination is proceeding as expected, and to give early warning of any common issues.
The individual shared models shall be combined for design review and clash detection by the Executive Architect and a federated model shall be made available in read only format to the whole team for model-based reviews and coordination throughout the project lifecycle and issued on to a shared area of the CDE.
Automated clash detection on the federated model will be carried out ahead of each BIM Workshop by the Executive Architect on behalf of the Client as the models are updated. The clash rules defined in >insert doc reference< allows us to efficiently break down clash results and clashes across models and different work packages. This is then broken up by buildings and floors within the site, allowing us to further focus on specific areas aligning with the critical path of the project program for construction to ensure delivery of the project is kept on track.
Automated Clash reports (Grouping of clashes) and any coordination reports will be created and issued to supplement the read only combined model and SHARED on the CDE.
Specialist clash detection should be discussed, costed with an agreed output prior to the project starting. Health and safety/CDM management
BIM and the CDE should support the management of health and safety and CDM requirements. The CDM meetings are to be integral with the BIM Modelling review process and are to be model based. This is to ensure that compliance with CDM is incorporated as part of the spatial design and modelling process. The review process is to include all relevant project teams to ensure the CDM requirements are met. The interactive coordination workshops allow Health and Safety issues to be visualized and a coordinated mitigation established. Integration of BIM can be incorporated into on-site toolbox talks and site inductions.
Responsibilities and Requirements
Each consultant will ensure that, they are using correct 3d view and Navisworks options editor setting for exporting any NWC files, KAA already provide the NWC export settings.
All consultant need to share their NWC files
Khatib and Alami will create NWC files for BOH
All consultants are responsible for submit a federated NWD file on a weekly basis.
Any NWC file naming changes should be inform Khatib and Alami and approved with TRSDC immediately with a proper mapping strategy,
All consultants are responsible for correct NWC building coordinates. If a building have multiple site position, we should all follow the architectural file export location,
All consultants can check the NWC file tracker for rectify their pending issues that uploaded on BIM360
Khatib and Alami will run clash detection and upload federated Navisworks models in BIM360,
All consultants are responsible to solve their own clashes,
Currently building are combine with respect of Volume/ System information of each assets and clash detection information will be built within this Naviswork model. Additionally each assets overall federated model are generated for design review.
Weekly Model Sharing & Clash Detection Road Map
All Navisworks models are shared on a weekly basis in BIM360 by the consultants. Those models will be used to run clash detection analysis.
All disciplines model mapping,
Clash detection life cycle,
Clash Detection Criteria
Discipline clashes are prioritized based on categories sets. Clash tolerance value are change when design reaches to next stage.
Type of Clashes
Hard Clash\Duplicated elements
Soft Clash\Clearance Clash
Hard clash\Duplicated elements
When two objects occupying the same space, it will be considered as a hard clash. For example, a duct placed where a beam designed or, a number of pipe running through a structural wall. Duplicated elements can show in the report and that’s when two elements had been placed in the same places which causes double count and generates a clash. For example, structural column copied on top of each other.
Soft clash\clearance refers to objects that demand certain spatial/geometric tolerances or buffers having objects within their buffer zone of access, insulation, maintenance or safety. For example, equipment placed in an unaccusable zone, access zones for maintenance of MEP systems.
Matrix and Tolerance
Current clash matrix are using discipline clash method,
Recent clash detective schedule are presenting “Discipline A” vs “Discipline B” a detail matrix with clash tolerance. Each face of the design, KA will be update the stage code and Tolerance. Currently KA is using 50mm tolerance.
Clash Detection Rules
Below is an example of the type of clash detection rules and tolerances that may be undertaken.
Note: All grey highlighted clashes will be managed by consultants.
Note: Foster + Partners to share Clash tolerances as per previous TRSDC projects based on Stages.
Health and safety/CDM management
BIM and the CDE should support the management of health and safety and CDM requirements. The CDM meetings are to be integral with the BIM Modelling review process and are to be model based. This is to ensure that compliance with CDM is incorporated as part of the spatial design and modelling process. The review process is to include all relevant project teams to ensure the CDM requirements are met. The interactive coordination workshops allow Health and Safety issues to be visualized and a coordinated mitigation established. Integration of BIM can be incorporated into on-site toolbox talks and site inductions.
APPENDIX A - BIM Documentation
The set of BIM Management documents are listed below, the forms are not mandatory for all projects, with the exception of the Model Production Delivery Table which is required for all BIM projects and the use of the various Toolkits is dictated by the project BIM Objectives defined in Section 3 of this BEP. All relevant BIM Toolkits will be available via the CDE.
APPENDIX B - BIM Capability Assessments
TRSDC has developed a robust in-house BIM strategy that informs and steers the company’s BIM application within the business. It is based on live BIM project experience and sets out the processes and procedures required for successful BIM project delivery for the entire project team.
TRSDC regularly reviews and updates their live data base of BIM capabilities to identify and maximize the added value that BIM can bring to them during and after construction. Project specific capability assessments are summarized in the table below.
APPENDIX C – LOD Descriptions

Publish your models from Revit to BIM 360 using Revit Cloud Worksharing.
Use the Design Collaboration module to create a package and share your models with other teams.
Other teams choose to consume the shared models.
The teams who have consumed the shared model use Revit to link to the model from their Consumed folder in the Document Management module.
Tip: When adding a link in Revit as a team that has consumed a shared model, navigate to your team's Consumed folder in Document Management (BIM 360://Project Name/Project Files/Your Team Name/Consumed/TeamName/FileName.rvt).
For BIM 360 Folder Structure Definitions refer to TRS-DS-GDL-0001 PMIS Design Review User Guide and TRS-PM-MNL-0013_BIM 360 - Design Collaboration user Guide.

DEFINITIONS
BIM Execution Plan (BEP) – also referred to as the ‘Information Delivery Plan’ in the ISO 19650
With each BIM project, the Project Information Manager (Appointing Party) will complete the guidelines and protocols document for each major stakeholder, relevant specifically to that project. This document is the template given by TRSDC as the baseline to be used for all BEP written by design and construction teams.
Building Information Modelling (BIM)
The process of designing, constructing and/or operating a building or infrastructure asset using electronic object-oriented information.
Clash Detection / Analysis
The process of identifying conflicts and issues between building systems by collaborating in 3D as part of the co-ordination process.
Collaboration
The sharing, and review of data between disciplines. Through BIM, this process can be smoother, quicker, and with each discipline adopting Project standards, the workflow can be realized with less disruption. The collaboration environment allows the sharing of models between disciplines aiding coordination and clash detection. Each discipline supplying BIMs, will be referred to as a Stakeholder in the coordination process.
Common Data Environment (CDE)
Single source of information for any given project, used to collect, manage and disseminate all relevant approved project information for multi-disciplinary teams in a managed process.
Data Scope
The agreed minimum set of attributes or property fields for the model elements in a model as identified in this document.
Federated Model
Refers to the combined model which incorporates the relevant models from the project team at a specified phase of the project and is developed to the level of detail as defined in the BIM execution plan.
FM / CAFM
Facilities Management is the production of information via the BIM, to be added into the client/contractors CAFM (computer aided facilities management) software. This information needs to be understood early as possible in the process to determine final application and usage.
GUID
Globally Unique Identifier. It is automatically produced by the software and assigned to each element.
Information Manager (Appointing Party)
Not to be confused with the Project Information Manager (Appointing Party), Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) or Task Information Manger (Appointed Party). The Information Manager will be a client appointed role to manage data within the Common Data Environment. He will typically be part of a wider appointment, for instance, part of the design team.
Level of Model Definition (LOMD)
Level of Model Definition is used to describe a combination of Level of Detail (LOD) and Level of Information (LOI) contained in BIM models.
Level of Detail (LOD)
The description of geometrical content of models.
Level of Information (LOI)
The description of non-geometrical content (attributes or information) of models.
Level of Information Need
Framework which defines the extent and granularity of information. This is a broader concept than level of model definition, level of model detail or level of model information, which can be considered as specific examples of level of information need.
Model Element
A Model Element is a portion of geometrical content of models representing a component, system or assembly within a building or infrastructure asset.
Model Element Author (MEA)
A Model Element Author is a responsible party for developing the geometrical and non-geometrical content of a specific model elements to required LOD and LOI specified in Model Production Delivery Table.
INTRODUCTION

Responsibilities: CDE – Aconex & BIM 360
Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party)
The Task Information Manager - Lead will be the primary point of contact who shall help define the BIM/Information strategy and act as primary liaison between all other project Task Teams on any BIM related issues.
The Task Information Manager - Lead shall liaise with the other design consultants as part of the same asset and determine the model configuration and advise consultants of the initial model setup and strategy that will define Project Information such as model origin, orientation, project level datum and units. He will instead methods and procedures for model coordination purposes and models quality controls.
Notes:
The Task Information Manager – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) is in no direct contract agreement with any of the other consultants on this project. Having said that, if any matters will arise related to fulfilling this function tasks that are conditioned by the contribution of other consultants the Task Information Manger - Lead (Lead Appointed Party) will inform the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) which is expecting to mitigate and provide a resolution on a reasonable time.
Task Information Manger (Appointed Party)
The Task Information Manager will be the primary point of contact at a Task Team level and will liaise directly with the Task Information Manager – Lead and the Project Information Manager (Appointing Party) to successfully implement the production of the BIM goals and responsibilities, in compliance with the project requirements following the standards, methods and procedures and using agreed system at an asset level.

4.2BIM Responsibility Matrix Members Allocation
*Project Consultant/Contractor Information Author (PCIA)
4.3Training/Induction
It is the responsibility of all parties and each Design Sub-Contractor to supply competent staff trained in the applications and tools they will be required to use on The Red Sea R08-HE2 - Shurayrah The Trail
The Consultants are responsible for providing guidance on the requirements applicable to the Project.
BIM DELIVERABLES
5.1Matrix of Responsibilities across the Supply Chain
The following table identifies BIM deliverables (high-level) and who models what (the BIM Author) and to what Level of Model Definition (LOMD) in a summarized format. The Model Production Delivery Table [MPDT] (Appendix D) will define the breakdown of individual model elements regarding their geometrical and information status as some elements will be required to be developed at different stages and with different levels of definition.
The following table has been filled out indicatively. Please refer to the EIR and omit or amend sections to follow project specific requirements. Please remove this text following any changes.
* Some specific elements that need further developing would be later defined or Covered in Notes and Construction Details
The BIM Timeline Table [BIM Timeline] (Appendix M) defines when all stakeholders should be exchanging and submitting their models to be used by the other consultants to coordinate and produce high quality drawings.
5.2Model Production Delivery Table
The Model Production Delivery Table [MPDT] (Appendix D) represents a responsibility matrix for the various model elements as well as definitions for Level of Development (LOD) and Level of Information (LOI).
This matrix is essential to outline the following items:
How the project is broken down into model elements at each project phase
Which elements are to be modelled.
Who is responsible for modelling each element.
What the minimum LOD and LOI each element is to be modelled to
If and when the responsibility of elements change ownership
Each Model Element Author’s content is intended to be shared with subsequent Model Element Authors (MEA) and Model Users throughout the course of the Project. Abbreviations are inserted for each MEA identified in [MPDT] (Appendix D) such as “KAA – Architect,” or “KEO – Lead Engineer”. LODs must be adapted for the unique characteristics of each Project.
The LOD Specification defines and illustrates characteristics of model elements of different building systems at different Levels of Development. This clear articulation allows model authors to define what their models can be relied on for and allows downstream users to clearly understand the usability and the limitations of models they are receiving.
The Model Production Delivery Table information will be collated by the Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) once the contractors are onboard based on their Task Information Delivery Table TIDP. This will be an ongoing process and might be stretched during multiple design stages. The Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party), will start the collection of TIDP’s on Schematic Design Stage.
The Red Sea Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) will review and follow up with a BIM meeting with all Task Information Mangers to confirm and clarify assigned responsibilities of element/component production assigned and outline any scope gaps or discrepancies with each party, concerning their required output for delivery.
Upon agreement this will then form the part of the guidelines to adhere to for BIM for the project which all parties will have to comply to. As stated in all Scope of services agreements issued with contract appointments the BEP and Appendices form the basis of what is required to be delivered by all parties on the project.
5.3Handover Deliverables
In the circumstances of a project handover from Signature Architect to Executive Architect, it is expected that all BIM information will be transferred. This will be centred around the latest BIM Execution Plan (BEP) which will outline the current state of development for the project. This along with related BIM documentation such as the Model Production Delivery Table (MPDT) and the Asset Information Requirements (AIR) will be handed over alongside any and all models required to continue the development of the project. If non-BIM models are required for certain design aspects such as complex geometry or site context, they must be included in any package.
At construction handover, the Client requires a complete Asset Information Model (AIM). Therefore, consultants on design stage and contractors on construction stage should work on an optimal way to make this happen.
The model will be revised as work packages are completed to record the as-built status of the works. The LOD for completed objects recorded as constructed by field staff will be updated to LOD 500 (Please refer to the [Model Production Delivery Table] (Appendix D) for more information).
The data structure which outlines requirements shall be further refined in the [AIR] to be developed following engagement with the Client FM team.
The importance of the interoperability and transfer of data that will be created for Handover to the Client shall be understood by all parties. The Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) will work closely with the Client in order to advise and ensure that the efficient transfer of data created integrates seamlessly with the desired FM system of choice by the Client.
Assets will be assessed with the intention of providing a list of proposed maintainable assets to the Client for discussion and agreement.
For a more detailed information on what should be delivered and when per project submission, please refer to [Master Information Delivery Plan (MIDT)] (Appendix j).
TECHNICAL MODELLING PROTOCOL
6.1Modelling Methods
Model information shall take account of construction methodology. Elements are to be modelled in line with how they are typically constructed e.g. walls span from structural floor to structural soffit and curtain walling is assigned to the ground floor level spanning multiple floors unless modular construction applies.
Some model elements may be modelled by using model in Place method when required, to take advantage of references in the main model and the modelling tools in this method, in particular during early stages such a: Concept Design and Schematic Design. Any in-Place modeled must be added to the Exemption list and approved by TRSDC.
All model elements should only exist in a single model, by a single contributor so there is no duplication of the same information (e.g. only one contributor models any given floor at any given LOD). A special attention needs to be considered between the Architect (Signature & Executive) while interfacing with the Interior Design contractor. The core walls ownership will stay with the Architect while finishes will be owned by the Interior Design Team. Areas and Rooms ownership will always fall under Architect responsibility. For a better understanding of the disciplines interfaces, please refer to Appendix N – Consultants Interface.
All design changes will be done in the source Information Model with relevant drawings re-exported and not as amendments to any exports (i.e. no changes to the 2D drawing). All model elements shall be created adhering to the boundaries of the project volumes where specified.
Rhino models may be used during the design development, but they will be converted into native Revit elements once the design progresses. If the Rhino models are required at the later design stages due to the complexity of the designed geometry, additional guidance and clarifications will be provides by the Rhino models authors to TRSDC and enlarge project team. Such scenarios will be highlighted as part of the BIM Exemption List. Any native Rhino/Grasshopper scripts will be provided as part of the sharing information. If specifics plug-ins or add-ins were used to aid with the interoperability process between Rhino and Revit, those will be documented and named within the BIM Exemption List.
The design review and approval process of 2D information derived from the models will be in accordance with the Design Management Procedure.
Each model contributors modelling obligations will be:
Contributors will concurrently develop the design and model as an iterative process.
Any element within a model which is illustrated on drawings will be derived from the model.
Contributors will use models as an explicit means to communicate design.
Contributors will ensure accuracy of the attribute data applied to elements.
6.2Model Setup
The Units for the projects shall be defined in metric units set to millimeters with rounding to the nearest millimeter. If alternate units are required, then dimensions shall be modified and developed to reflect alternate unit values.
Angles to use the decimal degrees and to be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle. Annotations related to angles should also be round up to the second fourth after the full angle.
E.G 20.5738⁰
Setting-out annotations related to building geolocations Easting, Northing and Site Elevation coordinates to be round up to the nearest millimeter and to be in sync’ed with the overall project set-up coordinates please see Section 6.3 – Model Coordinates.
Orientation to True North to follow where possible the angles round-up to the fourth decimal after the full angle. In order to avoid any confusion generated by the Revit sensibility over the model’s locations, it is recommended that the building locations are acquired, published or transferred between different consultants’ models rather than manually input them. Annotating the angle to True North will be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle.
6.3Model Coordinates
Model Coordinates should always be set to world coordinates, including (where known) the elevation. Project base points should be located to a Grid intersection, to the bottom left of the building (in project north), and survey point, should be located on a Project coordinate system ‘WGS 1984 UTM Zone 37N’ tile intersection to ensure accuracy or left at 0,0,0 for reference.
Coordinates are shown below for each type. Care should be taken to ensure that coordinates are clipped and pinned in place, to avoid them being moved. If a project base or survey points require moving, the original and proposed coordinates should be documented, and the design team made aware of this change.
For files with multiple coordinates refer to the Appendix I R08-HE2D03-KAA-SCH-AR-0011
All vertical levels are relative to Mean Sea level (MSL) at Jeddah. Another commonly used vertical datum at the site is LAT at Al-Wajh. Elevation (m MSL Jeddah) = Elevation (m LAT Al-Wajh) + 0.5954 m
6.4Federation Strategy
Federation Strategy, also referred to as the Information Container Breakdown Structure will be used as a foundation for coordination. It will allocate volumes within the project to different disciplines into which they carry out their system model. The proposed overall modelling and coordination strategy for the project will enable concurrent work on models and will be developed based on numerous factors such as:
Required project deliverables
Overall project procurement strategy
Coordination requirements and consultant/trade package split
Unique project challenges and project BIM Uses
Model file size – Consideration to be made of model performance. Model file size to be kept in within manageable extents. It´s recommended to keep models file size bigger than 300 MB
Capability of project team
Information Security
This will be further developed and updated as additional information and model authors are identified.
If trade contractors are unable to produce models for detailed design elements beyond the scope of the principle consultants, it shall be agreed between the relevant parties as to whether additional instructions are provided to the consultant to continue their design to an enhanced level or whether an independent modelling team are employed.
Volume/System parameters to be included if necessary, once reviewed with all the Task Information Mangers so that a common strategy that accommodate all consultants’ necessities is achieved.
All members of the supply chain are expected to review the table documenting volumes below and shall ensure that their models are developed in accordance with this strategy moving forward for the project.

6.5Specialist Discipline Integration into BIM Environment.
This section of the BEP refers to the BIM Information that is produced by TRSDC Consultants that are not contractually appointed to produce BIM Models, but will provide valuable Design and BIM Information that will have to be embedded into other Consultants BIM Models. Such information can be described as reach metadata and will for part of the LOI’s requirements or might even influence the size, shape and orientation of the design elements consequently altering the LOD’s requirements.
To make sure that this information is captured within the exchange BIM model deliverables, it is crucial that a Specialist Discipline Integration into BIM Environment matrix is established so that every consultant understands what information is provided, when it is provided and by whom.
Responsibilities
Specialist Discipline (No BIM Modelling Scope) Responsibilities.
To read and familiarize with the BEP and any other documentation related to overall project BIM Scope of Works
To provide the information that will have to be embedded into other Consultant BIM Models as a clear format that is easy to understand, process and integrate and it is following the Master Information Delivery Table (MPDT) format
To provide regular updates to all the Consultants with BIM Modelling Scope when new information is produced, or existing information has been altered.
To actively participate in BIM Weekly Meetings to make sure that relevant information is being captured
Specialist Discipline (No BIM Modelling Scope) Responsibilities.
Provide feedback to Specialist Discipline regarding the format expected of the information required to be embedded
Incorporate the Specialist Discipline information following the Master Information Delivery Table MPDT matrix
Specialist Discipline Integration Matrix
6.6File Naming Conventions
Also referred to as the Information Container Identification, the BIM project naming conventions will follow the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual. This file naming system is to be used for drawings and models only and should be used as the drawing/model name and within the title block for drawings.
Refer to the Appendix I with information about models’ naming.
Project Number
An alphanumeric code that is used by the project team to identify the project. The Program Code + Asset (Project) & Contract Code make up the Project Number.
Originator Code
An alphabetic code that represents the company responsible for that aspect of the work. The codes must represent the company name, and not the discipline.
Volume/ System
Two alphanumeric characters that relate to spatial sub-division of the project starting with Volume or System; ZZ is applied when all volumes are referred to.
Building Levels
2 alphanumeric characters that relate to Levels and Locations and is made up of two characters. This should align with the agreed project nomenclature outlined in Section 6.6 below. A guide to those codes as well as standard non-floor level codes is as follows in the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Document Type
A three-character alphanumeric code that indicates the type of information held within the information container.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Discipline / Role
The is a two-character indicating the discipline. Refer to the Red Sea Project Document Management System in the PMIS Manual and to [Drawing Series Numbers] (Appendix O).
Series Number
This is a unique 5-character code. The first two characters of the number should be used to signify an ‘element code’ that further classifies the file. One classification code system should be chosen and consistently used by all project teams. This number should always be used sequentially with leading zeroes.
i.e. Package Series (10XXX), multi-use number i.e. zone or building number (XX4XX) and the drawing number (XXX01)
Refer to the Refer to the Red Sea Document Management System in the PMIS Manual and to [Drawing Series Numbers] (Appendix O).
Additional Information for Submissions
Additional information parameters and their values shall be added to each sheet/title block when uploading or submitting on Aconex. The Contract/Work Package code and Revision number should not be included in the drawing or models name but should be stated for data entries on Aconex upload only.
Contract/Work Package
An alphabetic code that represents the work package.
Document Revision
An alphabetic code that represents the revision of the drawing at each Project Stage.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
6.7Level / Location Naming
A two-character alphanumeric code that represents the level or story of the building.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
6.8Rooms & Doors Naming Convention & Codes
Rooms naming convention should follow the design brief requirements and should be clearly identifiable. Rooms Codes should allow for unique rooms identification.
Doors codes provides every door in the building with an identification, which is further referred to in the door and ironmongery schedule. Doors are named after the room they are leading into. If more doors are present in the same room the ending number within the door code will receive and incremental number.
6.9Revit Views Naming Convention
Revit views are to be named in a consistent way using clear, descriptive naming protocol following the “Camel Case” syntax. This is applicable to all Plan, Sections, Elevations, Schedules and Legend Views.
6.10Worksets
Worksets should be named in a consistent and logical manner to aid navigation in the project browser. Workset organization should be carefully considered to provide the most efficient working environment for the Design Teams.
Worksets are named with a role code, optional zone code and a description of the content.
Discipline - Identifies the owner of the object – Element author.
Zone - Once Zones are defined, worksets can used this optional field to define zone specific worksets
Content - Content is a description of the use of the workset. E.g. Interior (internal wall systems, doors, ceilings, rooms etc.), cladding or furniture. If a project is split by zone or function only the content code can be omitted.
Note:
Shared Levels and Grids Worksets
The Shared Levels and Grids worksets do not include the role code and is named Shared Levels and Grids as the default workset created in Revit. This is to enable all Design Disciplines to turn off all grids and levels from models linked in the sheet model(s). The grids and levels in the sheet model however will be placed in a workset with the role code. E.g. A-Shared Levels and Grids would be in the architectural sheet models
Each Linked Revit File will be placed in its own Workset following the naming convention below:
The Main Worksets will be structured by FOSTER Foster + Partners in the Architecture Revit template models “Levels & Grids” and shared with all other BIM managerConsultants.
All teams should follow the same principles in structuring worksets in their own models.
All teams are responsible for of assigning the correct workset to their relevant elements in all their models to ensure proper coordination between disciplines linked models.
List of Worksets per Discipline:
- SIGNATURE ARCHITECT
- EXECUTIVE ARCHITECT (ARC)
- LEAD ENGINEERING
- KITCHEN & LAUNDRY CONSULTANT
- INTERIOR DESIGN CONSULTANT
Water Feature Worksets – Working Models
- SPA CONSULTANT
6.11Shared Parameters
A set of Master Shared Parameters that incorporates the client requirements will be distributed consistently across all design disciplines by the Lead Appointed Party [Master Shared Parameters] (Appendix G). Any amendments involving shared parameters that form part of the master shared parameters core will require approval from the Appointing Party and Lead Appointed Party.
For scenarios where design decisions are not yet finalized and multiple inputs may still be valid, the TRSDC Parameters will be filled in with all the current options listing first the Primary Option. For areas where the design has not yet progress that far to achieve a valid input the TRSDC Shared Parameters will be filled with TBC. At the handover stage the TRSDC Shared Parameters will be curated and will go through a final QA/QC that will only leave the Primary Option input.
E.G.
TRSDC_Material = Material_1 (Primary), Material_2, Material_3...etc
TRSDC_Material = TBC
All other Shared Parameters required at a discipline level will fall under each Appointed Party responsibility and all shared parameters files should be saved on BIM360 under the folder:
02_SHARED>XX>12_IM-Information Management>02_Supporting Files & Templates>02_Master Shared Parameters.
6.12Object Naming Convention
Model objects are to be named using clear, descriptive object naming for all object and family types prefixed by role or company reference. A list of object and family type codes are to be provided by each model contributor.
Where alternative object naming conventions have been used, these shall be detailed to the Project BIM Manager and TRSDC. Room naming shall be in accordance with the [EIR] if there is a room naming schema in place.
6.12.1 Best Practice
To get consistent results when searching for content, follow the specific rules set below:
All names should be in English
Use full words when possible
Names should be composed using characters A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9
Name should use CamelCase (no spaces, and capital words) unless otherwise noted in the following chapters
The following characters should not be used in any naming conventions:
,. ! “ £ $ % ^ & * ( ) { }[ ] + = < > ? | \ / @ ’ ~ #¬ ` ‘
6.12.2 Family Naming Convention
Family Full Name including all Family Types shall be limited to a maximum of 50 characters.
The name should use the underscore ”_” character as the delimiter between fields. The reason for this is that some programmatic scripts may interact with the hyphen.
Family files (.rfa) shall be named beginning with: <Role>_<Type>_<Subtype/Product>_<Descriptor1>
Role
Identifies the owner of the object – Library author.
Type
This field is the first level of specialisation. In other words, this is the highest level of family information in terms of purpose. This field should not be confused with the Revit Family Categories, although sometimes it might coincide (every object or family in Revit needs a category to define the object behavior and template).
For example, a door or a window family has a “Type” field that coincides with the Category but a table or a sink does not coincide. A table belongs to the Furniture category, the sink belongs to the Plumbing Fixtures category.
For example:
A_Door
A_Wall
A_Window
Subtype / Product
The Subtype / Product field forms the next logical level of information that distinguishes a family type from another.
For example:
A_Door_Sliding,
A_Door_Revolving
They are both doors but the subtype helps to differentiate between them. This field shouldn’t contain manufacturers.
If a new Subtype / Product needs to be created please discuss in the Information Management Meetings.
Descriptor 1
Optional - Brief User Description. The Descriptor 1 field is used to convey additional specialization information. It will help differentiate between subtypes.
For example:
A_Door_Sliding_GlassOpaque
A_Door_Sliding_GlassClear
A_Door_Sliding_GlassTempered
All families are sliding doors but the descriptor helps differentiate between them.
In the case of system families: Walls, Floors, Ceilings and Roofs Descriptor1 is the overall thickness.
For example:
A_Wall_Int_75mm
6.12.3 Type Naming Convention
All Revit Families should have at least 1 type. If this is not done, then the Family type name will inherit the family name when loaded into project.
If there is only one type don’t leave the field blank. Use ‘Type 1’
Indicate sizing in mm (fractional inches in case of Imperial) for Family components
Use Camel Case with spaces
Avoid repeating information already in the family name
Try using full words if possible; if needed, use abbreviations only from section 8 (Foster + Partners Abbreviations list)
All names must be in English
For example:
Family: A_Furniture_Chair
Family Type : Type 1
Chair Barcelona
Family: A_Casework_Suspended_SatinGloss
Family Type : 900 x 1500 x 300
As a best practice always use this syntax:
Width x Depth x Height
Family: A_Furniture_Table_Conference
Family Type : 900 x 1500
As a best practice always use this syntax:
Width x Length
6.12.4 Miscellaneous Revit Content Naming Convention
Groups and Assemblies
Groups should never be named with the default Revit naming convention Group 1, Group 2, etc as that is non-descriptive. Groups should never be used for a single instance, a common descriptor is a good starting point.
If it is the purpose of the group or assembly is to be able to move and select several elements again later use selection sets instead of groups or assemblies.
Scope Boxes
Scope boxes should be named in a logical manner for other team members to be able to use and find. There is no naming convention for scope boxes, but please follow these general guidelines:
Scope boxes should not be named according to packages, as the same scope box might very well be applicable for several drawing packages
Scale and location are good codes for their names
Scope boxes for GA drawings should use scale and the sheet number corresponding to the sheet their views are placed in
6.13Document Numbering
Document Numbering Convention should be following the Red Sea Project Document Management System in the PMIS Manual. Drawings will be including a Volume/System Series related with the Island Wide (for Landscape, Civils, Marine) and another Volume/System Series related with the Asset.
Island Wide
Volume/System Series should be always the top left intersection grids following the grid system shared by TRSDC. Depending of the scale, the scope boxes should start from the top left to right.
EX.: Two set of drawings at scale 1:100 (purple rectangles)
Assets
Volume/System Series should follow the asset series. It there is more than one asset in the same drawing, the lowest Volume System Serie should be used.
EX: R08-HE2D03-KAA-13-00-DWG-AR-10100
6.14Accuracy and Dimensions
No alterations/amendments to dimensions should ever be made when 2D drawings are extracted from the 3D models. The 2D drawings will form the contractual design information and so all dimensions for setting out is to be taken from them. By altering dimensions, the 3D models can no longer be used for reliable coordination reviews.
6.15Annotation Methods
A strategy should be followed based on the methods listed below:
Method 1 – Container file Strategy;
Method 2 – Multi file sheet production Strategy;
Method 3 – By Linked View Strategy;
6.15.1Annotation Tags
The following table identifies which parameters and methods are used per each consultant to tag the model elements.
The following table must be filled with which parameters have been used in the annotation tags.
6.16Drawing Scales
All drawings must be rendered and presented at one of several approved scales, which are typically defined by the ‘Task Team Manager’. All drawings created from model geometry must be presented at a scale showing appropriate detail. If the model is too large to be published at the agreed scale it should be subdivided over several sheets with reference to continuation sheets on the title block. Structure, MEP and Interior Design drawings should follow and be aligned with the Architectural drawing scales. Infrastructure, Civil and Landscape drawings should follow the same scaling strategy. Scales other than those approved should not be used.
All model files/geometry must be created at 1:1 real world size.
Any Schematic/Diagrams will not have any scale assigned
TECHNICAL DATA PROTOCOL
The Task Information Manger (Appointed Party) will provide the model data requirements and responsibilities for each data contributor.
Guidance on data entry and shared parameters will be provided where required. Consultants are asked to supply details of their data entry and in-house data checking procedures to the rest of the BIM team for transparency.
On the agreed dates, all parties will submit their 3D Models and/or associated data drops, which will be coordinated by the Task Information Manger (Appointed Party). All data drops are to be fully checked and the information verified before issue.
BIM Weekly (bi-weekly DWFx) Information Exchange
This exercise represents the WIP information exchange between consultants meant to help the design process.

IFC 2x3
Notes:
IFC 2x3. BIM Authoring Consultants cannot ensure the translation of the digital process to extract the information from the Revit model to IFC. The Revit file information prevails
Native file formats and IFC formats are required with each model upload. Native file formats are to be referred to if discrepancies arise from IFC outputs. Correct mapping options to be selected for IFC exports refer to Section 7.3 for guidance.
Drawings
2D drawing files in dwg format cut from the submitted models
PDF file format exported from Revit Drawings Sheets
DWG file format exported from Revit Drawings Sheets
Documents
This section is reserved for the upload of documents such as BEP’s, Project Stage Reports, Area Comparisons…etc. File formats can be (PDF, Excel, Word…etc).
7.1Project File Format Overview
7.2Project Task Teams File Format Exchanges
All base models (models containing the geometry) will be shared with TRSDC and project teams on a regular basis via the allocated space on the employer’s selected PMIS for the Red Sea Project.
The agreed model and drawing formats required for the data drops according with the information exchange schedules from Chapter 7 are:
<For Revit Based projects, all disciplines MUST use the same version of Autodesk Revit>
All file format exchanges must be agreed between parties at the beginning of the project and any further BIM workshops when new supply chain members are appointed. It must be adhered to throughout the life of the project. Deviations must only be made when exporting for Navisworks clash detection. File format will then be NWC, or for different platform collaboration, the use of IFC files is compulsory.
Technological advances and software are being reviewed to allow federated models to be hosted and viewed for a more ‘up-to-date’ collaboration workflow.
7.3IFC Guidance
To ensure effective collaboration between the multiple parties a series of trail/test IFC (International Foundation Class) exports will be scheduled. The export shall contain IFC objects for all discipline specific objects to be produced by each respective BIM author.
7.4IFC File Export Settings
Following a successful IFC exchange trial each BIM author must specify their IFC export settings. These settings should be shared under Appendix P – BIM Guides.
7.5Data Reviews
Data entry will be an ongoing process throughout the project, it will be carefully controlled with regular in-house data checks carried out by each discipline. Checks to include;
Project data parameters have been correctly input. As a minimum the following information shall be contained within the model:
Family correctly assigned.
Type
Level
Ref. to the type specific data in the Specification if that data is not otherwise embedded
Any other information specified in the Model Production Delivery Table
Organization contact details are correct and up to date
No data amendments once extracted from the 3D models
Data has been entered in the correct fields and format (e.g. alphanumeric)
Data has been entered at the correct type/instance level
Model and project protocols have been followed (naming conventions, levels etc.)
Duplicate objects removed from the models
The responsibility for correct data lies with the model in the same way as the responsibility for providing the correct geometry. However, the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) will conduct periodic data audits and issue reports documenting the results.
PROJECT WORKSHARING & COLLABORATION
Collaboration is vital to the success of a BIM Project. There are two aspects to collaboration; communication between people (under Meetings in Section 8.6), and the control and sharing of the project information and data described in the following sections.
8.1Model Collaboration
As part of BIM, the design shall be authored using BIM software collaboratively and in real time. Where work is performed in multiple offices or where subcontractors and suppliers are major participants in the BIM, the Consultants will facilitate the maximize “live” collaboration practicably possible and minimize the frequency and time lag of BIM updates to the Consultant’s master BIM from external participants. The BIM shall not be created at the end of the project only to meet project deliverables.
The Model Collaboration process will utilize the Autodesk BIM 360 platform – Design Collaboration module. It should follow the Appendix M – BIM Timeline.
BIM360 Package Exchange
The Work in Progress models should be shared by using BIM360 platform – Design Collaboration module. For a better understanding of the package exchanged, a naming convention should be used based in the following table:
Program & Project Code
This is a six-character indicating the Program Code and the Project Code.
Originator Code
An alphabetic code that represents the company responsible for that aspect of the work. The codes must represent the company name, and not the discipline – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Discipline / Role
This a two-character indicating the discipline. Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Package Exchange Code
The Package Exchange Code utilize the ISO 19650 Suitability Code (extracted from BS1192:2007+A2:2016), to define the status of the shared documents and Models between stakeholders.
Volume Code
Two alphanumeric characters that relate to spatial sub-division of the project starting with Volume or System; ZZ is applied when all volumes are referred to – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Sequence Number
Four digits sequential number – leading zeros should be used.
Volume Code
Two alphanumeric characters that relate to spatial sub-division of the project starting with Volume or System; ZZ is applied when all volumes are referred to – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Sequence Number
Four digits sequential number – leading zeros should be used.
8.2Common Data Environment & PMIS
The Common Data Environment is the working environment where all current, controlled project design information is stored and made available by controlled access. It is normally an application or group of applications that form the “single source of truth” for the building information.
A Common Data Environment (CDE) approach allows information to be shared effectively between all members of the project team; giving early access to information and avoiding risk of duplication. For this project Aconex and BIM 360 shall be the designated CDE’s.
BIM 360 will be utilized for all design related information which includes model uploads, PDFs and native design files. The following 3D views are required to be published on BIM 360:
One that contains only the discipline elements
Second that contains the federated model
Third that is tailored for export purposes that free of elements duplication between various design disciplines.
Aconex for other documentation such as word documents can be used as a check but formats unrelated to modelled information.
There are four main environments:
WIP (Work in Progress) – CDE
The working area within an organization’s own systems.
SHARED – CDE
The models that are regularly shared for use of entire project team. The Executive Architect will federate all models and the Task Information Manager contact from each organization will ensure all the latest relevant models are downloaded and federated into their WIP files.
All team members should be using other parties’ information for their own internal coordination checks. To progress to the next stage the information must be authorized by the appropriate person.
PUBLISHED – TRSDC PMIS
This information will have been accepted by the nominated party, in which case it will be suitable for tender or construction (2D model output only)
ARCHIVE – TRSDC PMIS
History of project information stored within the CDE.
Please refer to the BIM 360 User Guides and PMIS Manual for more information on folder structures and interaction with the systems.
8.3Model Upload Process
3D models must be shared at regular intervals to ensure the rest of the project team are coordinating with the latest information. This should happen following TRSDC BIM360 set-up environment.
8.3.1 BIM Models Exchange
Depending on which BIM Model format, the process of exchanging the information across all teams is different.
Revit Models Exchange
All native models should be exchanged using the Collaboration Pro module in BIM360 on a weekly basis. A proper naming convention should be followed – please refer to sub-topic 8.1.1 BIM360 Package Exchange. All consultants should be adding a description informing the major changes.
As the Interior Design consultants doesn´t have access to the Collaboration Pro module, Revit models must be exchanged manually. By having the models workshared in the work in progress folder – 01_WIP – all models should be copied into the folder by using the BIM360 feature: 02_SHARED>Asset folder>Discipline folder. Along with the Exchange, a communication should be sent out to all consultants informing the major changes.
All consultants should access to the 02_SHARED>Asset folder>Discipline folder and do a copy of the models into the Consumed folder: 01_WIP>Discipline folder>Consumed>HW3_06_ID-Interior Design – this folder should be created manually.
NWC and NWD Models Exchange
All Revit models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides – and uploaded manually into a folder in BIM360 located at: 03_SUBMISSIONS>01_OnGoing Design Coordination>12_IM-Information Management>Asset folder>weekly folder>NWC>Discipline folder.
DWFx Models Exchange
All DWF models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides – and uploaded manually into a folder located at: 03_SUBMISSIONS>01_OnGoing Design Coordination>12_IM-Information Management>Asset folder>weekly folder>NWFx>Discipline folder.
It´s required that the DWFx models contains 70% of the Omniclass codes included – please refer to APPENDIX J – Master Information Delivery Plan.
IFC Models Exchange
All IFC models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides. These models are only required to be exchanged on a gate submission and should be followed the workflow in place for the submissions.
BIM Models should be shared according to the table below:
8.4Software Usage
The following list only includes the software that is required to be compatible with the Client’s systems and will form part of the deliverables. These file formats will form the basis of coordination between all disciplines. All other software required for the project, including version, shall be agreed by each discipline in coordination with all parties. The versions are those agreed at project inception. Upgrades to subsequent versions of the software after commencement of the project shall be subject to agreement by TRSDC, in which case will occur at an agreed designated stage of the project and documented accordingly in this section.
<For Revit Based projects, all disciplines MUST use the same version of Autodesk Revit, outlined above. For software updates, all parties must agree for upgrade. Software type can be determined by the EIR’s >
8.5Clash Rendition Viewer
The clash rendition viewer to be used across the whole project.
8.6 BIM Meetings
A BIM Kick-off meeting will be held with all known supply chain members in order to run through the BIM deliverables for the project. This will directly reference the EIR and the processes for delivering BIM for the project. This meeting will be chaired by the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) and Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) who will attend all related team meetings.
This will then be followed by a meeting with all Task Information Managers from all project teams to go through the first draft of the BEP in a collaborative round table discussion and with agreement from all by its conclusion.
Moving forward; regular BIM meetings summarized below will commence with all Task Information Managers present from all relevant project team organizations. If not feasible for members of the project team to attend, then it is the team member’s responsibility to ensure arrangements are made for their members to still be in attendance through communication means.
The BIM related meeting plan will be developed by the Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) and the Interface Manager. The Design Coordination meeting frequency will vary through the contract period but in general will follow a weekly review or upon request for each of the Design Managers.
Summary of Meetings:
8.7Clash Detection and Coordination Meetings Schedule
The Clash Detection and Coordination Meetings will take place on a biweekly basis or as per client request. In order for this to happen there are several tasks that are required to be completed by each design consultant. The actual days will be confirmed, but the following cycle is intended to be followed.
Outlined below is the fortnightly plan of actions. This will be updated once the design coordination meeting schedule has been agreed.
MODEL REVIEWS
9.1Quality Control Procedures
Model audits are to be carried out regularly on the shared models for their compliance with this [BEP]. The process involves a combination of checks listed below to ensure there are no unresolved issues during construction or any significant loss of data upon transfer of as-built models and record documents at facility handover.
9.2 Clash Detection Process Overview
Automated clash detection is to be viewed as the last line of defense – it is always preferable to avoid unmanaged clashes through considered modelling than to rely on clash detection to identify and then resolve them.
Each BIM participant is responsible to maintain the integrity of the models and information and check/review these with their team manager as part of standard model collaboration before issuing to the SHARED part of the CDE.
If a clash is detected, according to the LOD per stage that cannot be resolved by the construction consultant and subcontracting team then the lead designer shall be involved in the discussion to reach an agreed solution. Individual subcontractors and consultants are responsible for making changes to their own model(s) only, and where/if required.
Automated clash detection of single discipline models is to be carried out by Task Team Information Managers at all project stages on a >specify frequency< basis using Navisworks Manage or similar software, by implementing the clash rules defined in >insert doc reference<. This is to ensure that coordination is proceeding as expected, and to give early warning of any common issues.
The individual shared models shall be combined for design review and clash detection by the Executive Architect and a federated model shall be made available in read only format to the whole team for model-based reviews and coordination throughout the project lifecycle and issued on to a shared area of the CDE.
Automated clash detection on the federated model will be carried out ahead of each BIM Workshop by the Executive Architect on behalf of the Client as the models are updated. The clash rules defined in >insert doc reference< allows us to efficiently break down clash results and clashes across models and different work packages. This is then broken up by buildings and floors within the site, allowing us to further focus on specific areas aligning with the critical path of the project program for construction to ensure delivery of the project is kept on track.
Automated Clash reports (Grouping of clashes) and any coordination reports will be created and issued to supplement the read only combined model and SHARED on the CDE.
Specialist clash detection should be discussed, costed with an agreed output prior to the project starting.
9.3 Responsibilities and Requirements
Each consultant will ensure that, they are using correct 3d view and Navisworks options editor setting for exporting any NWC files, KAA already provide the NWC export settings.
All consultant need to share their NWC files
Khatib and Alami will create NWC files for BOH
All consultants are responsible for submit a federated NWD file on a weekly basis.
Any NWC file naming changes should be inform Khatib and Alami and approved with TRSDC immediately with a proper mapping strategy,
All consultants are responsible for correct NWC building coordinates. If a building have multiple site position, we should all follow the architectural file export location,
All consultants can check the NWC file tracker for rectify their pending issues that uploaded on BIM360
Khatib and Alami will run clash detection and upload federated Navisworks models in BIM360,
All consultants are responsible to solve their own clashes,
Currently building are combine with respect of Volume/ System information of each assets and clash detection information will be built within this Naviswork model. Additionally each assets overall federated model are generated for design review.
9.4 Weekly Model Sharing & Clash Detection Road Map
All Navisworks models are shared on a weekly basis in BIM360 by the consultants. Those models will be used to run clash detection analysis.
All disciplines model mapping,
Clash detection life cycle,
9.5 Clash Detection Criteria
Discipline clashes are prioritized based on categories sets. Clash tolerance value are change when design reaches to next stage.
Type of Clashes
Hard Clash\Duplicated elements
Soft Clash\Clearance Clash
Hard clash\Duplicated elements
When two objects occupying the same space, it will be considered as a hard clash. For example, a duct placed where a beam designed or, a number of pipe running through a structural wall. Duplicated elements can show in the report and that’s when two elements had been placed in the same places which causes double count and generates a clash. For example, structural column copied on top of each other.
Soft clash\clearance refers to objects that demand certain spatial/geometric tolerances or buffers having objects within their buffer zone of access, insulation, maintenance or safety. For example, equipment placed in an unaccusable zone, access zones for maintenance of MEP systems.
9.6 Matrix and Tolerance
Current clash matrix are using discipline clash method,
Recent clash detective schedule are presenting “Discipline A” vs “Discipline B” a detail matrix with clash tolerance. Each face of the design, KA will be update the stage code and Tolerance. Currently KA is using 50mm tolerance.
9.7 Clash Detection Rules
Below is an example of the type of clash detection rules and tolerances that may be undertaken.
Note: All grey highlighted clashes will be managed by consultants.
Note: Khatib and Alami to share Clash tolerances as per previous TRSDC projects based on Stages.
9.4 Health and safety/CDM management
BIM and the CDE should support the management of health and safety and CDM requirements. The CDM meetings are to be integral with the BIM Modelling review process and are to be model based. This is to ensure that compliance with CDM is incorporated as part of the spatial design and modelling process. The review process is to include all relevant project teams to ensure the CDM requirements are met. The interactive coordination workshops allow Health and Safety issues to be visualized and a coordinated mitigation established. Integration of BIM can be incorporated into on-site toolbox talks and site inductions.
APPENDIX A - BIM Documentation
The set of BIM Management documents are listed below, the forms are not mandatory for all projects, with the exception of the Model Production Delivery Table which is required for all BIM projects and the use of the various Toolkits is dictated by the project BIM Objectives defined in Section 3 of this BEP. All relevant BIM Toolkits will be available via the CDE.
The following table has been filled out indicatively. Please omit or amend sections and remove this text following any changes.
APPENDIX B - BIM Capability Assessments

Sharing the Revit models with other project teams using BIM 360 Design. Through Controlled Sharing Consume Models from Packages. to share using this method:
Publish your models from Revit to BIM 360 using Revit Cloud Worksharing.
Use the Design Collaboration module to create a package and share your models with other teams.
Other teams choose to consume the shared models.
The teams who have consumed the shared model use Revit to link to the model from their Consumed folder in the Document Management module.
Tip: When adding a link in Revit as a team that has consumed a shared model, navigate to your team's Consumed folder in Document Management (BIM 360://Project Name/Project Files/Your Team Name/Consumed/TeamName/FileName.rvt).
For BIM 360 Folder Structure Definitions refer to TRS-DS-GDL-0001 PMIS Design Review User Guide and TRS-PM-MNL-0013_BIM 360 - Design Collaboration user Guide.

The BEP should be used as the agenda for this meeting and worked through systematically until populated. | One-off | All Project Participants | TBC | Project Information Manager;
Task Information Manger – Lead
BIM Weekly Meeting | The purpose of those meetings is to discuss BIM related items on a weekly basis. Topics related to these meetings can include but are not limited to: BEP Updates; Models Updates; Models Queries; BIM Strategy updates; Information Exchange…etc.
A relatively flexible agenda and meeting structure is prescribed to allow all project BIM representatives to present and resolve their queries. | Weekly | All Project BIM Representatives | Microsoft Teams | Task Information Manager – Lead
Clash Detections & Coordination Meeting | Coordination between all project teams to review clashes identified within the models. Task Information Manager (EA) to lead the meeting, visually exploring the models, identifying clashes that require resolution and documenting each agreed solution alongside a visual of the issue in the minutes. All models must be uploaded to the agreed exchange platform in both native and agreed 3D discipline-based model file format. All models must be uploaded to the agreed exchange platform two days ahead of this meeting to allow sufficient time to review the content within the model.
Interface Manager and Design Team Managers to mitigate and propose resolutions to clashes related to design.

This document is the template given by TRSDC as the baseline to be used for all BEP written by design and construction teams.
Building Information Modelling (BIM)
The process of designing, constructing and/or operating a building or infrastructure asset using electronic object-oriented information.
Clash Detection / Analysis
The process of identifying conflicts and issues between building systems by collaborating in 3D as part of the co-ordination process.
Collaboration
The sharing, and review of data between disciplines. Through BIM, this process can be smoother, quicker, and with each discipline adopting Project standards, the workflow can be realized with less disruption. The collaboration environment allows the sharing of models between disciplines aiding coordination and clash detection. Each discipline supplying BIMs, will be referred to as a Stakeholder in the coordination process.
Common Data Environment (CDE)
Single source of information for any given project, used to collect, manage and disseminate all relevant approved project information for multi-disciplinary teams in a managed process.
Data Scope
The agreed minimum set of attributes or property fields for the model elements in a model as identified in this document.
Federated Model
Refers to the combined model which incorporates the relevant models from the project team at a specified phase of the project and is developed to the level of detail as defined in the BIM execution plan.
FM / CAFM
Facilities Management is the production of information via the BIM, to be added into the client/contractors CAFM (computer aided facilities management) software. This information needs to be understood early as possible in the process to determine final application and usage.
GUID

Training/Induction
It is the responsibility of all parties and each Design Sub-Contractor to supply competent staff trained in the applications and tools they will be required to use on The Red Sea R08-HE3D01 - Shurayrah East Hotel #3.
The Consultants are responsible for providing guidance on the requirements applicable to the Project.
BIM DELIVERABLES
Matrix of Responsibilities across the Supply Chain
The following table identifies BIM deliverables (high-level) and who models what (the BIM Author) and to what Level of Model Definition (LOMD) in a summarized format. The Model Production Delivery Table [MPDT] (APPENDIX D – Model Production Delivery Table) will define the breakdown of individual model elements regarding their geometrical and information status as some elements will be required to be developed at different stages and with different levels of definition.
* - * Some specific elements that need further developing would be later defined or Covered in Notes and Construction Details
The BIM Timeline Table (APPENDIX M – BIM Timeline) defines when all stakeholders should be exchanging and submitting their models to be used by the other consultants to coordinate and produce high quality drawings.
Model Production Delivery Table
The Model Production Delivery Table [MPDT] (APPENDIX D – Model Production Delivery Table) represents a responsibility matrix for the various model elements as well as definitions for Level of Development (LOD) and Level of Information (LOI).
This matrix is essential to outline the following items:
How the project is broken down into model elements at each project phase
Which elements are to be modelled.
Who is responsible for modelling each element.
What the minimum LOD and LOI each element is to be modelled to
If and when the responsibility of elements change ownership
Each Model Element Author’s content is intended to be shared with subsequent Model Element Authors (MEA) and Model Users throughout the course of the Project. Abbreviations are inserted for each MEA identified in [MPDT] (APPENDIX D – Model Production Delivery Table) such as “FOS – Architect,” or “KEO – Lead Engineer”. LODs must be adapted for the unique characteristics of each Project.
The LOD Specification defines and illustrates characteristics of model elements of different building systems at different Levels of Development. This clear articulation allows model authors to define what their models can be relied on for and allows downstream users to clearly understand the usability and the limitations of models they are receiving.
The Model Production Delivery Table information will be collated by the Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) once the contractors are onboard based on their Task Information Delivery Table TIDP. This will be an ongoing process and might be stretched during multiple design stages. The Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party), will start the collection of TIDP’s on Schematic Design Stage.
The Red Sea Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) will review and follow up with a BIM meeting with all Task Information Mangers to confirm and clarify assigned responsibilities of element/component production assigned and outline any scope gaps or discrepancies with each party, concerning their required output for delivery.
Upon agreement this will then form the part of the guidelines to adhere to for BIM for the project which all parties will have to comply to. As stated in all Scope of services agreements issued with contract appointments the BEP and Appendices form the basis of what is required to be delivered by all parties on the project.
Handover Deliverables
In the circumstances of a project handover from Signature Architect to Executive Architect, it is expected that all BIM information will be transferred. This will be centred around the latest BIM Execution Plan (BEP) which will outline the current state of development for the project. This along with related BIM documentation such as the Model Production Delivery Table (MPDT) and the Asset Information Requirements (AIR) will be handed over alongside any and all models required to continue the development of the project. If non-BIM models are required for certain design aspects such as complex geometry or site context, they must be included in any package.
At construction handover, the Client requires a complete Asset Information Model (AIM). Therefore, consultants on design stage and contractors on construction stage should work on an optimal way to make this happen.
The model will be revised as work packages are completed to record the as-built status of the works. The LOD for completed objects recorded as constructed by field staff will be updated to LOD 500 (Please refer to the APPENDIX D – Model Production Delivery Table for more information).
The data structure which outlines requirements shall be further refined in the [AIR] to be developed following engagement with the Client FM team.
The importance of the interoperability and transfer of data that will be created for Handover to the Client shall be understood by all parties. The Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) will work closely with the Client in order to advise and ensure that the efficient transfer of data created integrates seamlessly with the desired FM system of choice by the Client.
Assets will be assessed with the intention of providing a list of proposed maintainable assets to the Client for discussion and agreement.
For a more detailed information on what should be delivered and when per project submission, please refer to APPENDIX J – Master Information Delivery Table.
TECHNICAL MODELLING PROTOCOL
Modelling Methods
Model information shall take account of construction methodology. Elements are to be modelled in line with how they are typically constructed e.g. walls span from structural floor to structural soffit and curtain walling is assigned to the ground floor level spanning multiple floors unless modular construction applies.
Some model elements may be modelled by using model in Place method when required, to take advantage of references in the main model and the modelling tools in this method, particularly during early stages such a: Concept Design and Schematic Design.
All model elements should only exist in a single model, by a single contributor so there is no duplication of the same information (e.g. only one contributor models any given floor at any given LOD). A special attention needs to be considered between the Architect (Signature & Executive) while interfacing with the Interior Design contractor. The core walls ownership will stay with the Architect while finishes will be owned by the Interior Design Team. Areas and Rooms ownership will always fall under Architect responsibility. For a better understanding of the disciplines interfaces, please refer to APPENDIX N – Consultants Interface.
All design changes will be done in the source Information Model with relevant drawings re-exported and not as amendments to any exports (i.e. no changes to the 2D drawing). All model elements shall be created adhering to the boundaries of the project volumes where specified.
Rhino models may be used during the design development, but they will be converted into native Revit elements once the design progresses. If the Rhino models are required at the later design stages due to the complexity of the designed geometry, additional guidance and clarifications will be provides by the Rhino models authors to TRSDC and enlarge project team. Such scenarios will be highlighted as part of the BIM Exemption List. Any native Rhino/Grasshopper scripts will be provided as part of the sharing information. If specifics plug-ins or add-ins were used to aid with the interoperability process between Rhino and Revit, those will be documented and named within the BIM Exemption List.
The design review and approval process of 2D information derived from the models will be in accordance with the Design Management Procedure.
Each model contributors modelling obligations will be:
Contributors will concurrently develop the design and model as an iterative process.
Any element within a model which is illustrated on drawings will be derived from the model.
Contributors will use models as an explicit means to communicate design.
Contributors will ensure accuracy of the attribute data applied to elements.
Model Setup
The Units for the projects shall be defined in metric units set to millimeters with rounding to the nearest millimeter. If alternate units are required, then dimensions shall be modified and developed to reflect alternate unit values.
Angles to use the decimal degrees and to be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle. Annotations related to angles should also be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle.
E.G 20.57⁰
Setting-out annotations related to building geolocations Easting, Northing and Site Elevation coordinates to be round up to the nearest millimeter and to be in sync’ed with the overall project set-up coordinates please see Section 6.3 – Model Coordinates.
Orientation to True North to follow where possible the angles round-up to the fourth decimal after the full angle. In order to avoid any confusion generated by the Revit sensibility over the models locations, it is recommended that the building locations are acquired, published or transferred between different consultants’ models rather than manually input them. Annotating the angle to True North will be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle.
Model Coordinates
Model Coordinates should always be set to world coordinates, including (where known) the elevation. Project base points should be located to a Grid intersection, to the bottom left of the building (in project north), and survey point, should be located on a Project coordinate system ‘WGS 1984 UTM Zone 37N’ tile intersection to ensure accuracy or left at 0,0,0 for reference.
Coordinates are shown below for each type. Care should be taken to ensure that coordinates are clipped and pinned in place, to avoid them being moved. If a project base or survey points require moving, the original and proposed coordinates should be documented, and the design team made aware of this change.
For files with multiple coordinates refer to the APPENDIX I – Models Multiple Shared Location - R08-HE3D01-FOS-SCH-AR-0009.xlsx
All vertical levels are relative to Mean Sea level (MSL) at Jeddah. Another commonly used vertical datum at the site is LAT at Al-Wajh. Elevation (m MSL Jeddah) = Elevation (m LAT Al-Wajh) + 0.5954 m
Federation Strategy
Federation Strategy, also referred to as the Information Container Breakdown Structure will be used as a foundation for coordination. It will allocate volumes within the project to different disciplines into which they carry out their system model. The proposed overall modelling and coordination strategy for the project will enable concurrent work on models and will be developed based on numerous factors such as:
Required project deliverables
Overall project procurement strategy
Coordination requirements and consultant/trade package split
Unique project challenges and project BIM Uses
Model file size – Consideration to be made of model performance. Model file size to be kept in within manageable extents. It´s recommended to keep models file size bigger than 300 MB.
Capability of project team
Information Security
This will be further developed and updated as additional information and model authors are identified.
If trade contractors are unable to produce models for detailed design elements beyond the scope of the principle consultants, it shall be agreed between the relevant parties as to whether additional instructions are provided to the consultant to continue their design to an enhanced level or whether an independent modelling team are employed.
Volume/System parameters to be included, if necessary, once reviewed with all the Task Information Mangers so that a common strategy that accommodate all consultants’ necessities is achieved.
All members of the supply chain are expected to review the table documenting volumes below and shall ensure that their models are developed in accordance with this strategy moving forward for the project.

Content - Content is a description of the use of the workset. E.g. Interior (internal wall systems, doors, ceilings, rooms etc.), cladding or furniture. If a project is split by zone or function only the content code can be omitted.
Note:
Shared Levels and Grids Worksets
The Shared Levels and Grids worksets do not include the role code and is named Shared Levels and Grids as the default workset created in Revit. This is to enable all Design Disciplines to turn off all grids and levels from models linked in the sheet model(s). The grids and levels in the sheet model however will be placed in a workset with the role code. E.g. A-Shared Levels and Grids would be in the architectural sheet models
Each Linked Revit File will be placed in its own Workset following the naming convention below:
The Main Worksets will be structured by Foster + Partners in the Architecture Revit template models “Levels & Grids” and shared with all other Consultants.
All teams should follow the same principles in structuring worksets in their own models.
All teams are responsible for assigning the correct workset to their relevant elements in all their models to ensure proper coordination between disciplines linked models.
List of Worksets per Discipline:
- SIGNATURE ARCHITECT
- EXECUTIVE ARCHITECT
- KITCHEN & LAUNDRY CONSULTANT
- INTERIOR DESIGN CONSULTANT
- LANDSCAPE CONSULTANT
Landscape Worksets – Working Models
Landscape Worksets – Amenities Container
Landscape Worksets – Villas Container
Landscape Worksets – Clusters Container
Water Feature Worksets – Working Models
Water Feature Worksets – Amenities Container
Water Feature Worksets – Villas Container
Water Feature Worksets – Clusters Container
SPA CONSULTANT
Shared Parameters
A set of Master Shared Parameters that incorporates the client requirements will be distributed consistently across all design disciplines by the Lead Appointed Party [Master Shared Parameters] (APPENDIX G – Master Shared Parameters). Any amendments involving shared parameters that form part of the master shared parameters core will require approval from the Appointing Party and Lead Appointed Party.
For scenarios where design decisions are not yet finalized and multiple inputs may still be valid, the TRSDC Parameters will be filled in with all the current options listing first the Primary Option. For areas where the design has not yet progress that far to achieve a valid input the TRSDC Shared Parameters will be filled with TBC. At the handover stage the TRSDC Shared Parameters will be curated and will go through a final QA/QC that will only leave the Primary Option input.
E.G.
TRSDC_Material = Material_1 (Primary), Material_2, Material_3...etc
TRSDC_Material = TBC
All other Shared Parameters required at a discipline level will fall under each Appointed Party responsibility and all shared parameters files should be saved on BIM360 under the folder:
02_SHARED>XX>12_IM-Information Management>02_Supporting Files & Templates>02_Master Shared Parameters
Object Naming Convention
Model objects are to be named using clear, descriptive object naming for all object and family types prefixed by role or company reference. A list of object and family type codes are to be provided by each model contributor.
Where alternative object naming conventions have been used, these shall be detailed to the Project BIM Manager and TRSDC. Room naming shall be in accordance with the [EIR] if there is a room naming schema in place.
Best Practice
To get consistent results when searching for content, follow the specific rules set below:
All names should be in English
Use full words when possible
Names should be composed using characters A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9
Name should use CamelCase (no spaces, and capital words) unless otherwise noted in the following chapters
The following characters should not be used in any naming conventions:
,. ! “ £ $ % ^ & * ( ) { }[ ] + = < > ? | \ / @ ’ ~ #¬ ` ‘
Family Naming Convention
Family Full Name including all Family Types shall be limited to a maximum of 50 characters.
The name should use the underscore ”_” character as the delimiter between fields. The reason for this is that some programmatic scripts may interact with the hyphen.
Family files (.rfa) shall be named beginning with: <Role>_<Type>_<Subtype/Product>_<Descriptor1>
Role
Identifies the owner of the object – Library author.
Type
This field is the first level of specialisation. In other words, this is the highest level of family information in terms of purpose. This field should not be confused with the Revit Family Categories, although sometimes it might coincide (every object or family in Revit needs a category to define the object behavior and template).
For example, a door or a window family has a “Type” field that coincides with the Category but a table or a sink does not coincide. A table belongs to the Furniture category, the sink belongs to the Plumbing Fixtures category.
For example:
A_Door
A_Wall
A_Window
Subtype / Product
The Subtype / Product field forms the next logical level of information that distinguishes a family type from another.
For example:
A_Door_Sliding,
A_Door_Revolving
They are both doors but the subtype helps to differentiate between them. This field shouldn’t contain manufacturers.
If a new Subtype / Product needs to be created please discuss in the Information Management Meetings.
Descriptor 1
Optional - Brief User Description. The Descriptor 1 field is used to convey additional specialization information. It will help differentiate between subtypes.
For example:
A_Door_Sliding_GlassOpaque
A_Door_Sliding_GlassClear
A_Door_Sliding_GlassTempered
All families are sliding doors but the descriptor helps differentiate between them.
In the case of system families: Walls, Floors, Ceilings and Roofs Descriptor1 is the overall thickness.
For example:
A_Wall_Int_75mm
Type Naming Convention
All Revit Families should have at least 1 type. If this is not done, then the Family type name will inherit the family name when loaded into project.
If there is only one type don’t leave the field blank. Use ‘Type 1’
Indicate sizing in mm (fractional inches in case of Imperial) for Family components
Use Camel Case with spaces
Avoid repeating information already in the family name
Try using full words if possible; if needed, use abbreviations only from section 8 (Foster + Partners Abbreviations list)
All names must be in English
For example:
Family: A_Furniture_Chair
Family Type : Type 1
Chair Barcelona
Family: A_Casework_Suspended_SatinGloss
Family Type : 900 x 1500 x 300
As a best practice always use this syntax:
Width x Depth x Height
Family: A_Furniture_Table_Conference
Family Type : 900 x 1500
As a best practice always use this syntax:
Width x Length
Miscellaneous Revit Content Naming Convention
Groups and Assemblies
Groups should never be named with the default Revit naming convention Group 1, Group 2, etc as that is non-descriptive. Groups should never be used for a single instance, a common descriptor is a good starting point.
If it is the purpose of the group or assembly is to be able to move and select several elements again later use selection sets instead of groups or assemblies.
Scope Boxes
Scope boxes should be named in a logical manner for other team members to be able to use and find. There is no naming convention for scope boxes, but please follow these general guidelines:
Scope boxes should not be named according to packages, as the same scope box might very well be applicable for several drawing packages
Scale and location are good codes for their names
Scope boxes for GA drawings should use scale and the sheet number corresponding to the sheet their views are placed in
Document Numbering
Document Numbering Convention should be following the Red Sea Project Document Management System in the PMIS Manual. Drawings will be including a Volume/System Series related with the Island Wide (for Landscape, Civils, Marine) and another Volume/System Series related with the Asset.
Island Wide
Volume/System Series should be always the top left intersection grids following the grid system shared by TRSDC. Depending of the scale, the scope boxes should start from the top left to right.
EX.: Two set of drawings at scale 1:100 (purple rectangles)
Assets
Volume/System Series should follow the asset series. It there is more than one asset in the same drawing, the lowest Volume System Serie should be used.
EX: R08-HE3D01-FOS-13-00-DWG-AR-10100
Accuracy and Dimensions
No alterations/amendments to dimensions should ever be made when 2D drawings are extracted from the 3D models. The 2D drawings will form the contractual design information and so all dimensions for setting out is to be taken from them. By altering dimensions, the 3D models can no longer be used for reliable coordination reviews.
Annotation Methods
A strategy should be followed based on the methods listed below:
Method 1 – Container file Strategy;
Method 2 – Multi file sheet production Strategy;
Method 3 – By Linked View Strategy;
Annotation Tags
The following table identifies which parameters and methods are used per each consultant to tag the model elements.
Drawing Scales
All drawings must be rendered and presented at one of several approved scales, which are typically defined by the ‘Task Team Manager’. All drawings created from model geometry must be presented at a scale showing appropriate detail. If the model is too large to be published at the agreed scale it should be subdivided over several sheets with reference to continuation sheets on the title block. Structure, MEP and Interior Design drawings should follow and be aligned with the Architectural drawing scales. Infrastructure, Civil and Landscape drawings should follow the same scaling strategy. Scales other than those approved should not be used.
All model files/geometry must be created at 1:1 real world size.
Any Schematic/Diagrams will not have any scale assigned
TECHNICAL DATA PROTOCOL
The Task Information Manger (Appointed Party) will provide the model data requirements and responsibilities for each data contributor.
Guidance on data entry and shared parameters will be provided where required. Consultants are asked to supply details of their data entry and in-house data checking procedures to the rest of the BIM team for transparency.
On the agreed dates, all parties will submit their 3D Models and/or associated data drops, which will be coordinated by the Task Information Manger (Appointed Party). All data drops are to be fully checked and the information verified before issue.
BIM Weekly (bi-weekly DWFx) Information Exchange
This exercise represents the WIP information exchange between consultants meant to help the design process.
Native discipline-based 3D model files product specific for all design and analysis models (RVT)
Prior to publishing the models to BIM360 for creating a Design Collaboration Package Exchange, a Publish Set should be created and including 2D/3D views:

IFC 2x3
Notes:
IFC 2x3. BIM Authoring Consultants cannot ensure the translation of the digital process to extract the information from the Revit model to IFC. The Revit file information prevails
Native file formats and IFC formats are required with each model upload. Native file formats are to be referred to if discrepancies arise from IFC outputs. Correct mapping options to be selected for IFC exports refer to Section 7.3 for guidance.
Drawings
2D drawing files in dwg format cut from the submitted models
PDF file format exported from Revit Drawings Sheets
DWG file format exported from Revit Drawings Sheets
Documents
This section is reserved for the upload of documents such as BEP’s, Project Stage Reports, Area Comparisons…etc. File formats can be (PDF, Excel, Word…etc).
Project File Format Overview
Project Task Teams File Format Exchanges
All base models (models containing the geometry) will be shared with TRSDC and project teams on a regular basis via the allocated space on the employer’s selected PMIS for the Red Sea Project.
The agreed model and drawing formats required for the data drops according with the information exchange schedules from Chapter 7are:
<For Revit Based projects, all disciplines MUST use the same version of Autodesk Revit>
All file format exchanges must be agreed between parties at the beginning of the project and any further BIM workshops when new supply chain members are appointed. It must be adhered to throughout the life of the project. Deviations must only be made when exporting for Navisworks clash detection. File format will then be NWC, or for different platform collaboration, the use of IFC files is compulsory.
Technological advances and software are being reviewed to allow federated models to be hosted and viewed for a more ‘up-to-date’ collaboration workflow.
IFC Guidance
To ensure effective collaboration between the multiple parties a series of trail/test IFC (International Foundation Class) exports will be scheduled. The export shall contain IFC objects for all discipline specific objects to be produced by each respective BIM author.
IFC File Export Settings
Following a successful IFC exchange trial each BIM author must specify their IFC export settings. These settings should be shared under Appendix P – BIM Guides.
Data Reviews
Data entry will be an ongoing process throughout the project, it will be carefully controlled with regular in-house data checks carried out by each discipline. Checks to include;
Project data parameters have been correctly input. As a minimum the following information shall be contained within the model:
Family correctly assigned.
Type
Level
Ref. to the type specific data in the Specification if that data is not otherwise embedded
Any other information specified in the Model Production Delivery Table
Organization contact details are correct and up to date
No data amendments once extracted from the 3D models
Data has been entered in the correct fields and format (e.g. alphanumeric)
Data has been entered at the correct type/instance level
Model and project protocols have been followed (naming conventions, levels etc.)
Duplicate objects removed from the models
The responsibility for correct data lies with the model in the same way as the responsibility for providing the correct geometry. However, the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) will conduct periodic data audits and issue reports documenting the results.
PROJECT WORKSHARING & COLLABORATION
Collaboration is vital to the success of a BIM Project. There are two aspects to collaboration; communication between people (under Meetings in Section 8.6), and the control and sharing of the project information and data described in the following sections.
Model Collaboration
As part of BIM, the design shall be authored using BIM software collaboratively and in real time. Where work is performed in multiple offices or where subcontractors and suppliers are major participants in the BIM, the Consultants will facilitate the maximize “live” collaboration practicably possible and minimize the frequency and time lag of BIM updates to the Consultant’s master BIM from external participants. The BIM shall not be created at the end of the project only to meet project deliverables.
The Model Collaboration process will utilize the Autodesk BIM 360 platform – Design Collaboration module. It should follow the APPENDIX M – BIM Timeline.
BIM360 Package Exchange
The Work in Progress models should be shared by using BIM360 platform – Design Collaboration module. For a better understanding of the package exchanged, a naming convention should be used based in the following table:
Program & Project Code
This is a six-character indicating the Program Code and the Project Code.
Originator Code
An alphabetic code that represents the company responsible for that aspect of the work. The codes must represent the company name, and not the discipline – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Discipline / Role
This a two-character indicating the discipline. Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Package Exchange Code
This a two-character which indicates the package content use.
Volume Code
Two alphanumeric characters that relate to spatial sub-division of the project starting with Volume or System; ZZ is applied when all volumes are referred to – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Sequence Number
Four digits sequential number – leading zeros should be used.
Common Data Environment & PMIS
The Common Data Environment is the working environment where all current, controlled project design information is stored and made available by controlled access. It is normally an application or group of applications that form the “single source of truth” for the building information.
A Common Data Environment (CDE) approach allows information to be shared effectively between all members of the project team; giving early access to information and avoiding risk of duplication. For this project Aconex and BIM 360 shall be the designated CDE’s.
BIM 360 will be utilized for all design related information which includes model uploads, PDFs and native design files. The following 3D views are required to be published on BIM 360:
One that contains only the discipline elements
Second that contains the federated model
Third that is tailored for export purposes that free of elements duplication between various design disciplines.
Aconex for other documentation such as word documents can be used as a check but formats unrelated to modelled information.
There are four main environments:
WIP (Work in Progress) – CDE
The working area within an organization’s own systems.
SHARED – CDE
The models that are regularly shared for use of entire project team. The Executive Architect will federate all models and the Task Information Manager contact from each organization will ensure all the latest relevant models are downloaded and federated into their WIP files.
All team members should be using other parties’ information for their own internal coordination checks. To progress to the next stage the information must be authorized by the appropriate person.
PUBLISHED – TRSDC PMIS
This information will have been accepted by the nominated party, in which case it will be suitable for tender or construction (2D model output only)
ARCHIVE – TRSDC PMIS
History of project information stored within the CDE.
Please refer to the BIM 360 User Guides and PMIS Manual for more information on folder structures and interaction with the systems.
Model Upload Process
3D models must be shared at regular intervals to ensure the rest of the project team are coordinating with the latest information. This should happen following TRSDC BIM360 set-up environment.
BIM Models Exchange
Depending on which BIM Model format, the process of exchanging the information across all teams is different.
Revit Models Exchange
All native models should be exchanged using the Collaboration Pro module in BIM360 on a weekly basis. A proper naming convention should be followed – please refer to sub-topic 8.1.1 BIM360 Package Exchange. All consultants should be adding a description informing the major changes.
As the Interior Design consultants doesn´t have access to the Collaboration Pro module, Revit models must be exchanged manually. By having the models workshared in the work in progress folder – 01_WIP – all models should be copied into the folder by using the BIM360 feature: 02_SHARED>Asset folder>Discipline folder. Along with the Exchange, a communication should be sent out to all consultants informing the major changes.
All consultants should access to the 02_SHARED>Asset folder>Discipline folder and do a copy of the models into the Consumed folder: 01_WIP>Discipline folder>Consumed>HW3_06_ID-Interior Design – this folder should be created manually.
NWC and NWD Models Exchange
All Revit models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides – and uploaded manually into a folder in BIM360 located at: 03_SUBMISSIONS>01_OnGoing Design Coordination>12_IM-Information Management>Asset folder>weekly folder>NWC>Discipline folder.
DWFx Models Exchange
All DWF models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides – and uploaded manually into a folder located at: 03_SUBMISSIONS>01_OnGoing Design Coordination>12_IM-Information Management>Asset folder>weekly folder>NWFx>Discipline folder.
It´s required that the DWFx models contains 70% of the Omniclass codes included – please refer to APPENDIX J – Master Information Delivery Plan.
IFC Models Exchange
All IFC models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides. These models are only required to be exchanged on a gate submission and should be followed the workflow in place for the submissions.
BIM Models should be shared according to the table below:
Software Usage
The following list only includes the software that is required to be compatible with the Client’s systems and will form part of the deliverables. These file formats will form the basis of coordination between all disciplines. All other software required for the project, including version, shall be agreed by each discipline in coordination with all parties. The versions are those agreed at project inception. Upgrades to subsequent versions of the software after commencement of the project shall be subject to agreement by TRSDC, in which case will occur at an agreed designated stage of the project and documented accordingly in this section.
<For Revit Based projects, all disciplines MUST use the same version of Autodesk Revit, outlined above. For software updates, all parties must agree for upgrade. Software type can be determined by the EIR’s >
Clash Rendition Viewer
The clash rendition viewer to be used across the whole project.
BIM Meetings
A BIM Kick-off meeting will be held with all known supply chain members in order to run through the BIM deliverables for the project. This will directly reference the EIR and the processes for delivering BIM for the project. This meeting will be chaired by the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) and Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) who will attend all related team meetings.
This will then be followed by a meeting with all Task Information Managers from all project teams to go through the first draft of the BEP in a collaborative round table discussion and with agreement from all by its conclusion.
Moving forward; regular BIM meetings summarized below will commence with all Task Information Managers present from all relevant project team organizations. If not feasible for members of the project team to attend, then it is the team member’s responsibility to ensure arrangements are made for their members to still be in attendance through communication means.
The BIM related meeting plan will be developed by the Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) and the Interface Manager. The Design Coordination meeting frequency will vary through the contract period but in general will follow a weekly review or upon request for each of the Design Managers.
Summary of Meetings:
Clash Detection and Coordination Meetings Schedule
The Clash Detection and Coordination Meetings will take place on a biweekly basis or as per client request. In order for this to happen there are several tasks that are required to be completed by each design consultant. The actual days will be confirmed, but the following cycle is intended to be followed.
Outlined below is the fortnightly plan of actions. This will be updated once the design coordination meeting schedule has been agreed.
MODEL REVIEWS
Quality Control Procedures
Model audits are to be carried out regularly on the shared models for their compliance with this [BEP]. The process involves a combination of checks listed below to ensure there are no unresolved issues during construction or any significant loss of data upon transfer of as-built models and record documents at facility handover.
Clash Detection Process Overview
Automated clash detection is to be viewed as the last line of defense – it is always preferable to avoid unmanaged clashes through considered modelling than to rely on clash detection to identify and then resolve them.
Each BIM participant is responsible to maintain the integrity of the models and information and check/review these with their team manager as part of standard model collaboration before issuing to the SHARED part of the CDE.
If a clash is detected, according to the LOD per stage, that cannot be resolved by the construction, consultant and subcontracting team then the lead designer shall be involved in the discussion to reach an agreed solution. Individual subcontractors and consultants are responsible for making changes to their own model(s) only, and where/if required.
Automated clash detection of single discipline models is to be carried out by Task Team Information Managers at all project stages on a >specify frequency< basis using Navisworks Manage or similar software, by implementing the clash rules defined in >insert doc reference<. This is to ensure that coordination is proceeding as expected, and to give early warning of any common issues.
The individual shared models shall be combined for design review and clash detection by the Executive Architect and a federated model shall be made available in read only format to the whole team for model-based reviews and coordination throughout the project lifecycle and issued on to a shared area of the CDE.
Automated clash detection on the federated model will be carried out ahead of each BIM Workshop by the Executive Architect on behalf of the Client as the models are updated. The clash rules defined in >insert doc reference< allows us to efficiently break down clash results and clashes across models and different work packages. This is then broken up by buildings and floors within the site, allowing us to further focus on specific areas aligning with the critical path of the project program for construction to ensure delivery of the project is kept on track.
Automated Clash reports (Grouping of clashes) and any coordination reports will be created and issued to supplement the read only combined model and SHARED on the CDE.
Specialist clash detection should be discussed, costed with an agreed output prior to the project starting.
Responsibilities and Requirements
Each consultant will ensure that, they are using correct 3d view and Navisworks options editor setting for exporting any NWC files, KAA already provide the NWC export settings.
All consultant need to share their NWC files
Khatib and Alami will create NWC files for BOH
All consultants are responsible for submit a federated NWD file on a weekly basis.
Any NWC file naming changes should be inform Khatib and Alami and approved with TRSDC immediately with a proper mapping strategy,
All consultants are responsible for correct NWC building coordinates. If a building have multiple site position, we should all follow the architectural file export location,
All consultants can check the NWC file tracker for rectify their pending issues that uploaded on BIM360
Khatib and Alami will run clash detection and upload federated Navisworks models in BIM360,
All consultants are responsible to solve their own clashes,
Currently building are combine with respect of Volume/ System information of each assets and clash detection information will be built within this Naviswork model. Additionally each assets overall federated model are generated for design review.
9.4 Weekly Model Sharing & Clash Detection Road Map
All Navisworks models are shared on a weekly basis in BIM360 by the consultants. Those models will be used to run clash detection analysis.
All disciplines model mapping,
Clash detection life cycle,
9.5 Clash Detection Criteria
Discipline clashes are prioritized based on categories sets. Clash tolerance value are change when design reaches to next stage.
Type of Clashes
Hard Clash\Duplicated elements
Soft Clash\Clearance Clash
Hard clash\Duplicated elements
When two objects occupying the same space, it will be considered as a hard clash. For example, a duct placed where a beam designed or, a number of pipe running through a structural wall. Duplicated elements can show in the report and that’s when two elements had been placed in the same places which causes double count and generates a clash. For example, structural column copied on top of each other.
Soft clash\clearance refers to objects that demand certain spatial/geometric tolerances or buffers having objects within their buffer zone of access, insulation, maintenance or safety. For example, equipment placed in an unaccusable zone, access zones for maintenance of MEP systems.
9.6 Matrix and Tolerance
Current clash matrix are using discipline clash method,
Recent clash detective schedule are presenting “Discipline A” vs “Discipline B” a detail matrix with clash tolerance. Each face of the design, KA will be update the stage code and Tolerance. Currently KA is using 50mm tolerance.
9.7 Clash Detection Rules
Below is an example of the type of clash detection rules and tolerances that may be undertaken.
Note: All grey highlighted clashes will be managed by consultants.
Note: Foster + Partners to share Clash tolerances as per previous TRSDC projects based on Stages.
Health and safety/CDM management
BIM and the CDE should support the management of health and safety and CDM requirements. The CDM meetings are to be integral with the BIM Modelling review process and are to be model based. This is to ensure that compliance with CDM is incorporated as part of the spatial design and modelling process. The review process is to include all relevant project teams to ensure the CDM requirements are met. The interactive coordination workshops allow Health and Safety issues to be visualized and a coordinated mitigation established. Integration of BIM can be incorporated into on-site toolbox talks and site inductions.
APPENDIX A - BIM Documentation
The set of BIM Management documents are listed below, the forms are not mandatory for all projects, with the exception of the Model Production Delivery Table which is required for all BIM projects and the use of the various Toolkits is dictated by the project BIM Objectives defined in Section 3 of this BEP. All relevant BIM Toolkits will be available via the CDE.
APPENDIX B - BIM Capability Assessments
TRSDC has developed a robust in-house BIM strategy that informs and steers the company’s BIM application within the business. It is based on live BIM project experience and sets out the processes and procedures required for successful BIM project delivery for the entire project team.
TRSDC regularly reviews and updates their live data base of BIM capabilities to identify and maximize the added value that BIM can bring to them during and after construction. Project specific capability assessments are summarized in the table below.

Use the Design Collaboration module to create a package and share your models with other teams.
Other teams choose to consume the shared models.
The teams who have consumed the shared model use Revit to link to the model from their Consumed folder in the Document Management module.
Tip: When adding a link in Revit as a team that has consumed a shared model, navigate to your team's Consumed folder in Document Management (BIM 360://Project Name/Project Files/Your Team Name/Consumed/TeamName/FileName.rvt).

*Project Consultant/Contractor Information Author (PCIA)
Training/Induction
It is the responsibility of all parties and each Design Sub-Contractor to supply competent staff trained in the applications and tools they will be required to use on The Red Sea R08-HE4D03 - Shurayrah East Hotel #4.
The Consultants are responsible for providing guidance on the requirements applicable to the Project.
BIM DELIVERABLES
Matrix of Responsibilities across the Supply Chain
The following table identifies BIM deliverables (high-level) and who models what (the BIM Author) and to what Level of Model Definition (LOMD) in a summarized format. The Model Production Delivery Table [MPDT] (Appendix D) will define the breakdown of individual model elements regarding their geometrical and information status as some elements will be required to be developed at different stages and with different levels of definition.
* Some specific elements that need further developing would be later defined or Covered in Notes and Construction Details
The BIM Timeline Table [BIM Timeline] (Appendix M) defines when all stakeholders should be exchanging and submitting their models to be used by the other consultants to coordinate and produce high quality drawings.
Model Production Delivery Table
The Model Production Delivery Table [MPDT] (Appendix D) represents a responsibility matrix for the various model elements as well as definitions for Level of Development (LOD) and Level of Information (LOI).
This matrix is essential to outline the following items:
How the project is broken down into model elements at each project phase
Which elements are to be modelled.
Who is responsible for modelling each element.
What the minimum LOD and LOI each element is to be modelled to
If and when the responsibility of elements change ownership
Each Model Element Author’s content is intended to be shared with subsequent Model Element Authors (MEA) and Model Users throughout the course of the Project. Abbreviations are inserted for each MEA identified in [MPDT] (Appendix D) such as “FOS – Architect,” or “KEO – Lead Engineer”. LODs must be adapted for the unique characteristics of each Project.
The LOD Specification defines and illustrates characteristics of model elements of different building systems at different Levels of Development. This clear articulation allows model authors to define what their models can be relied on for and allows downstream users to clearly understand the usability and the limitations of models they are receiving.
The Model Production Delivery Table information will be collated by the Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) once the contractors are onboard based on their Task Information Delivery Table TIDP. This will be an ongoing process and might be stretched during multiple design stages. The Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party), will start the collection of TIDP’s on Schematic Design Stage.
The Red Sea Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) will review and follow up with a BIM meeting with all Task Information Mangers to confirm and clarify assigned responsibilities of element/component production assigned and outline any scope gaps or discrepancies with each party, concerning their required output for delivery.
Upon agreement this will then form the part of the guidelines to adhere to for BIM for the project which all parties will have to comply to. As stated in all Scope of services agreements issued with contract appointments the BEP and Appendices form the basis of what is required to be delivered by all parties on the project.
Handover Deliverables
In the circumstances of a project handover from Signature Architect to Executive Architect, it is expected that all BIM information will be transferred. This will be centred around the latest BIM Execution Plan (BEP) which will outline the current state of development for the project. This along with related BIM documentation such as the Model Production Delivery Table (MPDT) and the Asset Information Requirements (AIR) will be handed over alongside any and all models required to continue the development of the project. If non-BIM models are required for certain design aspects such as complex geometry or site context, they must be included in any package.
At construction handover, the Client requires a complete Asset Information Model (AIM). Therefore, consultants on design stage and contractors on construction stage should work on an optimal way to make this happen.
The model will be revised as work packages are completed to record the as-built status of the works. The LOD for completed objects recorded as constructed by field staff will be updated to LOD 500 (Please refer to the Model Production Delivery Table for more information).
The data structure which outlines requirements shall be further refined in the [AIR] to be developed following engagement with the Client FM team.
The importance of the interoperability and transfer of data that will be created for Handover to the Client shall be understood by all parties. The Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) will work closely with the Client in order to advise and ensure that the efficient transfer of data created integrates seamlessly with the desired FM system of choice by the Client.
Assets will be assessed with the intention of providing a list of proposed maintainable assets to the Client for discussion and agreement.
For a more detailed information on what should be delivered and when per project submission, please refer to [Master Information Delivery Plan (MIDT)] (Appendix J).
TECHNICAL MODELLING PROTOCOL
Modelling Methods
Model information shall take account of construction methodology. Elements are to be modelled in line with how they are typically constructed e.g. walls span from structural floor to structural soffit and curtain walling is assigned to the ground floor level spanning multiple floors unless modular construction applies.
Some model elements may be modelled by using model in Place method when required, to take advantage of references in the main model and the modelling tools in this method, in particular during early stages such a: Concept Design and Schematic Design. Any in-Place modeled must be added to the Exemption list and approved by TRSDC.
All model elements should only exist in a single model, by a single contributor so there is no duplication of the same information (e.g. only one contributor models any given floor at any given LOD). A special attention needs to be considered between the Architect (Signature & Executive) while interfacing with the Interior Design contractor. The core walls ownership will stay with the Architect while finishes will be owned by the Interior Design Team. Areas and Rooms ownership will always fall under Architect responsibility. For a better understanding of the discipline’s interfaces, please refer to Appendix N – Consultants Interface.
All design changes will be done in the source Information Model with relevant drawings re-exported and not as amendments to any exports (i.e. no changes to the 2D drawing). All model elements shall be created adhering to the boundaries of the project volumes where specified.
Rhino models may be used during the design development, but they will be converted into native Revit elements once the design progresses. If the Rhino models are required at the later design stages due to the complexity of the designed geometry, additional guidance and clarifications will be provides by the Rhino models authors to TRSDC and enlarge project team. Such scenarios will be highlighted as part of the BIM Exemption List. Any native Rhino/Grasshopper scripts will be provided as part of the sharing information. If specifics plug-ins or add-ins were used to aid with the interoperability process between Rhino and Revit, those will be documented and named within the BIM Exemption List.
The design review and approval process of 2D information derived from the models will be in accordance with the Design Management Procedure.
Each model contributors modelling obligations will be:
Contributors will concurrently develop the design and model as an iterative process.
Any element within a model which is illustrated on drawings will be derived from the model.
Contributors will use models as an explicit means to communicate design.
Contributors will ensure accuracy of the attribute data applied to elements.
Model Setup
The Units for the projects shall be defined in metric units set to millimeters with rounding to the nearest millimeter. If alternate units are required, then dimensions shall be modified and developed to reflect alternate unit values.
Angles to use the decimal degrees and to be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle. Annotations related to angles should also be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle.
E.G 20.5738⁰
Setting-out annotations related to building geolocations Easting, Northing and Site Elevation coordinates to be round up to the nearest millimeter and to be in sync’ed with the overall project set-up coordinates please see Section 6.3 – Model Coordinates.
Orientation to True North to follow where possible the angles round-up to the fourth decimal after the full angle. In order to avoid any confusion generated by the Revit sensibility over the model’s locations, it is recommended that the building locations are acquired, published or transferred between different consultants’ models rather than manually input them. Annotating the angle to True North will be round up to the fourth decimal after the full angle.
Model Coordinates
Model Coordinates should always be set to world coordinates, including (where known) the elevation. Project base points should be located to a Grid intersection, to the bottom left of the building (in project north), and survey point, should be located on a Project coordinate system ‘WGS 1984 UTM Zone 37N’ tile intersection to ensure accuracy or left at 0,0,0 for reference.
Coordinates are shown below for each type. Care should be taken to ensure that coordinates are clipped and pinned in place, to avoid them being moved. If a project base or survey points require moving, the original and proposed coordinates should be documented, and the design team made aware of this change.
For files with multiple coordinates refer to the Appendix I - R08-HE4D03-FOS-SCH-AR-0011
All vertical levels are relative to Mean Sea level (MSL) at Jeddah. Another commonly used vertical datum at the site is LAT at Al-Wajh. Elevation (m MSL Jeddah) = Elevation (m LAT Al-Wajh) + 0.5954 m
Federation Strategy
Federation Strategy, also referred to as the Information Container Breakdown Structure will be used as a foundation for coordination. It will allocate volumes within the project to different disciplines into which they carry out their system model. The proposed overall modelling and coordination strategy for the project will enable concurrent work on models and will be developed based on numerous factors such as:
Required project deliverables
Overall project procurement strategy
Coordination requirements and consultant/trade package split
Unique project challenges and project BIM Uses
Model file size – Consideration to be made of model performance. Model file size to be kept in within manageable extents. It´s recommended to keep models file size bigger than 300 MB
Capability of project team
Information Security
This will be further developed and updated as additional information and model authors are identified.
If trade contractors are unable to produce models for detailed design elements beyond the scope of the principle consultants, it shall be agreed between the relevant parties as to whether additional instructions are provided to the consultant to continue their design to an enhanced level or whether an independent modelling team are employed.
Volume/System parameters to be included if necessary, once reviewed with all the Task Information Mangers so that a common strategy that accommodate all consultants’ necessities is achieved.
All members of the supply chain are expected to review the table documenting volumes below and shall ensure that their models are developed in accordance with this strategy moving forward for the project.

Specialist Discipline Integration into BIM Environment.
This section of the BEP refers to the BIM Information that is produced by TRSDC Consultants that are not contractually appointed to produce BIM Models, but will provide valuable Design and BIM Information that will have to be embedded into other Consultants BIM Models. Such information can be described as reach metadata and will for part of the LOI’s requirements or might even influence the size, shape and orientation of the design elements consequently altering the LOD’s requirements.
To make sure that this information is captured within the exchange BIM model deliverables, it is crucial that a Specialist Discipline Integration into BIM Environment matrix is established so that every consultant understands what information is provided, when it is provided and by whom.
Responsibilities
Specialist Discipline (No BIM Modelling Scope) Responsibilities.
To read and familiarize with the BEP and any other documentation related to overall project BIM Scope of Works
To provide the information that will have to be embedded into other Consultant BIM Models as a clear format that is easy to understand, process and integrate and it is following the Master Information Delivery Table (MPDT) format
To provide regular updates to all the Consultants with BIM Modelling Scope when new information is produced, or existing information has been altered– information needed to be agreed by TRSDC and Consultants.
To actively participate in BIM Weekly Meetings to make sure that relevant information is being captured
Specialist Discipline (No BIM Modelling Scope) Responsibilities.
Provide feedback to Specialist Discipline regarding the format expected of the information required to be embedded
Incorporate the Specialist Discipline information following the Master Information Delivery Table MPDT matrix
Specialist Discipline Integration Matrix
File Naming Conventions
Also referred to as the Information Container Identification, the BIM project naming conventions will follow the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual. This file naming system is to be used for drawings and models only and should be used as the drawing/model name and within the title block for drawings.
Project Number
An alphanumeric code that is used by the project team to identify the project. The Program Code + Asset (Project) & Contract Code make up the Project Number.
Originator Code
An alphabetic code that represents the company responsible for that aspect of the work. The codes must represent the company name, and not the discipline.
Volume/ System
2 alphanumeric characters that relate to spatial sub-division of the project starting with Volume or System; ZZ is applied when all volumes are referred to.
Building Levels
2 alphanumeric characters that relate to Levels and Locations and is made up of two characters. This should align with the agreed project nomenclature outlined in Section 6.6 below. A guide to those codes as well as standard non-floor level codes is as follows in the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Document Type
A three-character alphanumeric code that indicates the type of information held within the information container.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual and to [Drawing Series Numbers] (Appendix O).
Discipline / Role
The is a two-character indicating the discipline. Refer to the Red Sea Project Document Management System in the PMIS Manual and to [Drawing Series Numbers] (Appendix O).
Series Number
This is a unique 5-character code. The first two characters of the number should be used to signify an ‘element code’ that further classifies the file. One classification code system should be chosen and consistently used by all project teams. This number should always be used sequentially with leading zeroes.
i.e. Package Series (10XXX), multi-use number i.e. zone or building number (XX4XX) and the drawing number (XXX01)
Refer to the Refer to the Red Sea Document Management System in the PMIS Manual and to [Drawing Series Numbers] (Appendix O).
Additional Information for Submissions
Additional information parameters and their values shall be added to each sheet/title block when uploading or submitting on Aconex. The Contract/Work Package code and Revision number should not be included in the drawing or models name but should be stated for data entries on Aconex upload only.
Contract/Work Package
An alphabetic code that represents the work package.
Document Revision
An alphabetic code that represents the revision of the drawing at each Project Stage.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Level / Location Naming
A two-character alphanumeric code that represents the level or story of the building.
Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Rooms & Doors Naming Convention & Codes
Rooms naming convention should follow the design brief requirements and should be clearly identifiable. Rooms Codes should allow for unique rooms identification.
Doors codes provides every door in the building with an identification, which is further referred to in the door and ironmongery schedule. Doors are named after the room they are leading into. If more doors are present in the same room the ending number within the door code will receive and incremental number.
Revit Views Naming Convention
Revit views are to be named in a consistent way using clear, descriptive naming protocol following the “Camel Case” syntax. This is applicable to all Plan, Sections, Elevations, Schedules and Legend Views.
Worksets
Worksets should be named in a consistent and logical manner to aid navigation in the project browser. Workset organization should be carefully considered to provide the most efficient working environment for the Design Teams.
Worksets are named with a role code, optional zone code and a description of the content.
Discipline - Identifies the owner of the object – Element author.
Zone - Once Zones are defined, worksets can used this optional field to define zone specific worksets
Content - Content is a description of the use of the workset. E.g. Interior (internal wall systems, doors, ceilings, rooms etc.), cladding or furniture. If a project is split by zone or function only the content code can be omitted.
Note:
Shared Levels and Grids Worksets
The Shared Levels and Grids worksets do not include the role code and is named Shared Levels and Grids as the default workset created in Revit. This is to enable all Design Disciplines to turn off all grids and levels from models linked in the sheet model(s). The grids and levels in the sheet model however will be placed in a workset with the role code. E.g. A-Shared Levels and Grids would be in the architectural sheet models
Each Linked Revit File will be placed in its own Workset following the naming convention below:
The Main Worksets will be structured by Foster + Partners in the Architecture Revit template models “Levels & Grids” and shared with all other Consultants.
All teams should follow the same principles in structuring worksets in their own models.
All teams are responsible for assigning the correct workset to their relevant elements in all their models to ensure proper coordination between disciplines linked models.
List of Worksets per Discipline:
- SIGNATURE ARCHITECT
- EXECUTIVE ARCHITECT (ARC)
- LEAD ENGINEER CONSULTANT
- KITCHEN & LAUNDRY CONSULTANT
- INTERIOR DESIGN CONSULTANT
- LANDSCAPE CONSULTANT
Landscape Worksets – Working Models
Landscape Worksets – Amenities Container
Landscape Worksets – Villas Container
Landscape Worksets – Clusters Container
Water Feature Worksets – Working Models
Water Feature Worksets – Amenities Container
Water Feature Worksets – Villas Container
- SPA CONSULTANT
Shared Parameters
A set of Master Shared Parameters that incorporates the client requirements will be distributed consistently across all design disciplines by the Lead Appointed Party [Master Shared Parameters] (Appendix G). Any amendments involving shared parameters that form part of the master shared parameters core will require approval from the Appointing Party and Lead Appointed Party.
For scenarios where design decisions are not yet finalized and multiple inputs may still be valid, the TRSDC Parameters will be filled in with all the current options listing first the Primary Option. For areas where the design has not yet progress that far to achieve a valid input the TRSDC Shared Parameters will be filled with TBC. At the handover stage the TRSDC Shared Parameters will be curated and will go through a final QA/QC that will only leave the Primary Option input.
E.G.
TRSDC_Material = Material_1 (Primary), Material_2, Material_3...etc
TRSDC_Material = TBC
All other Shared Parameters required at a discipline level will fall under each Appointed Party responsibility and all shared parameters files should be saved on BIM360 under the folder:
02_SHARED>XX>12_IM-Information Management>02_Supporting Files & Templates>02_Master Shared Parameters
Object Naming Convention
Model objects are to be named using clear, descriptive object naming for all object and family types prefixed by role or company reference. A list of object and family type codes are to be provided by each model contributor.
Where alternative object naming conventions have been used, these shall be detailed to the Project BIM Manager and TRSDC. Room naming shall be in accordance with the [EIR] if there is a room naming schema in place.
Best Practice
To get consistent results when searching for content, follow the specific rules set below:
All names should be in English
Use full words when possible
Names should be composed using characters A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9
Name should use CamelCase (no spaces, and capital words) unless otherwise noted in the following chapters
The following characters should not be used in any naming conventions:
,. ! “ £ $ % ^ & * ( ) { }[ ] + = < > ? | \ / @ ’ ~ #¬ ` ‘
Family Naming Convention
Family Full Name including all Family Types shall be limited to a maximum of 50 characters.
The name should use the underscore ”_” character as the delimiter between fields. The reason for this is that some programmatic scripts may interact with the hyphen.
Family files (.rfa) shall be named beginning with: <Role>_<Type>_<Subtype/Product>_<Descriptor1>
Role
Identifies the owner of the object – Library author.
Type
This field is the first level of specialisation. In other words, this is the highest level of family information in terms of purpose. This field should not be confused with the Revit Family Categories, although sometimes it might coincide (every object or family in Revit needs a category to define the object behavior and template).
For example, a door or a window family has a “Type” field that coincides with the Category but a table or a sink does not coincide. A table belongs to the Furniture category, the sink belongs to the Plumbing Fixtures category.
For example:
A_Door
A_Wall
A_Window
Subtype / Product
The Subtype / Product field forms the next logical level of information that distinguishes a family type from another.
For example:
A_Door_Sliding,
A_Door_Revolving
They are both doors but the subtype helps to differentiate between them. This field shouldn’t contain manufacturers.
If a new Subtype / Product needs to be created please discuss in the Information Management Meetings.
Descriptor 1
Optional - Brief User Description. The Descriptor 1 field is used to convey additional specialization information. It will help differentiate between subtypes.
For example:
A_Door_Sliding_GlassOpaque
A_Door_Sliding_GlassClear
A_Door_Sliding_GlassTempered
All families are sliding doors but the descriptor helps differentiate between them.
In the case of system families: Walls, Floors, Ceilings and Roofs Descriptor1 is the overall thickness.
For example:
A_Wall_Int_75mm
Type Naming Convention
All Revit Families should have at least 1 type. If this is not done, then the Family type name will inherit the family name when loaded into project.
If there is only one type don’t leave the field blank. Use ‘Type 1’
Indicate sizing in mm (fractional inches in case of Imperial) for Family components
Use Camel Case with spaces
Avoid repeating information already in the family name
Try using full words if possible; if needed, use abbreviations only from section 8 (Foster + Partners Abbreviations list)
All names must be in English
For example:
Family: A_Furniture_Chair
Family Type : Type 1
Chair Barcelona
Family: A_Casework_Suspended_SatinGloss
Family Type : 900 x 1500 x 300
As a best practice always use this syntax:
Width x Depth x Height
Family: A_Furniture_Table_Conference
Family Type : 900 x 1500
As a best practice always use this syntax:
Width x Length
Miscellaneous Revit Content Naming Convention
Groups and Assemblies
Groups should never be named with the default Revit naming convention Group 1, Group 2, etc as that is non-descriptive. Groups should never be used for a single instance, a common descriptor is a good starting point.
If it is the purpose of the group or assembly is to be able to move and select several elements again later use selection sets instead of groups or assemblies.
Scope Boxes
Scope boxes should be named in a logical manner for other team members to be able to use and find. There is no naming convention for scope boxes, but please follow these general guidelines:
Scope boxes should not be named according to packages, as the same scope box might very well be applicable for several drawing packages
Scale and location are good codes for their names
Scope boxes for GA drawings should use scale and the sheet number corresponding to the sheet their views are placed in
Document Numbering
Document Numbering Convention should be following the Red Sea Project Document Management System in the PMIS Manual. Drawings will be including a Volume/System Series related with the Island Wide (for Landscape, Civils, Marine) and another Volume/System Series related with the Asset.
Island Wide
Volume/System Series should be always the top left intersection grids following the grid system shared by TRSDC. Depending of the scale, the scope boxes should start from the top left to right.
EX.: Two set of drawings at scale 1:100 (purple rectangles)
Assets
Volume/System Series should follow the asset series. It there is more than one asset in the same drawing, the lowest Volume System Serie should be used.
EX: R08-HE4D03-FOS-13-00-DWG-AR-10100
Accuracy and Dimensions
No alterations/amendments to dimensions should ever be made when 2D drawings are extracted from the 3D models. The 2D drawings will form the contractual design information and so all dimensions for setting out is to be taken from them. By altering dimensions, the 3D models can no longer be used for reliable coordination reviews.
Annotation Methods
A strategy should be followed based on the methods listed below:
Method 1 – Container file Strategy;
Method 2 – Multi file sheet production Strategy;
Method 3 – By Linked View Strategy;
Annotation Tags
The following table identifies which parameters and methods are used per each consultant to tag the model elements.
Drawing Scales
All drawings must be rendered and presented at one of several approved scales, which are typically defined by the ‘Task Team Manager’. All drawings created from model geometry must be presented at a scale showing appropriate detail. If the model is too large to be published at the agreed scale it should be subdivided over several sheets with reference to continuation sheets on the title block. Structure, MEP and Interior Design drawings should follow and be aligned with the Architectural drawing scales. Infrastructure, Civil and Landscape drawings should follow the same scaling strategy. Scales other than those approved should not be used.
All model files/geometry must be created at 1:1 real world size.
Any Schematic/Diagrams will not have any scale assigned
TECHNICAL DATA PROTOCOL
The Task Information Manger (Appointed Party) will provide the model data requirements and responsibilities for each data contributor.
Guidance on data entry and shared parameters will be provided where required. Consultants are asked to supply details of their data entry and in-house data checking procedures to the rest of the BIM team for transparency.
On the agreed dates, all parties will submit their 3D Models and/or associated data drops, which will be coordinated by the Task Information Manger (Appointed Party). All data drops are to be fully checked and the information verified before issue.
BIM Weekly (bi-weekly DWFx) Information Exchange
This exercise represents the WIP information exchange between consultants meant to help the design process.
Native discipline-based 3D model files product specific for all design and analysis models (RVT)
Prior to publishing the models to BIM360 for creating a Design Collaboration Package Exchange, a Publish Set should be created and including 2D/3D views:
BIM360-3DView-Architectural Elements – 3D view with Consultant design intent which is not yet designed/handed over by/to the consultant responsible for it
BIM360-3DView-Export – 3D view only with Consultant´s elements visible which is under the scope. Tis view should be used to export the model to other BIM models formats: IFC, NWC and DWFx;
BIM360-3DView-Federated Model – 3D View with all consultant’s elements visible.
A 2D view Floor Plan for every different building level.
Naming conventions to be followed “XXX “- 2D View - Floor Plan “Description”
e.g. FOS - 2D View - Floor Plan Ground Floor

IFC 2x3
Notes:
IFC 2x3. BIM Authoring Consultants cannot ensure the translation of the digital process to extract the information from the Revit model to IFC. The Revit file information prevails
Native file formats and IFC formats are required with each model upload. Native file formats are to be referred to if discrepancies arise from IFC outputs. Correct mapping options to be selected for IFC exports refer to Section 7.3 for guidance.
Drawings
2D drawing files in dwg format cut from the submitted models
PDF file format exported from Revit Drawings Sheets
DWG file format exported from Revit Drawings Sheets
Documents
This section is reserved for the upload of documents such as BEP’s, Project Stage Reports, Area Comparisons…etc. File formats can be (PDF, Excel, Word…etc).
Project File Format Overview
Project Task Teams File Format Exchanges
All base models (models containing the geometry) will be shared with TRSDC and project teams on a regular basis via the allocated space on the employer’s selected PMIS for the Red Sea Project.
The agreed model and drawing formats required for the data drops according with the information exchange schedules from Chapter 7 are:
<For Revit Based projects, all disciplines MUST use the same version of Autodesk Revit>
All file format exchanges must be agreed between parties at the beginning of the project and any further BIM workshops when new supply chain members are appointed. It must be adhered to throughout the life of the project. Deviations must only be made when exporting for Navisworks clash detection. File format will then be NWC, or for different platform collaboration, the use of IFC files is compulsory.
Technological advances and software are being reviewed to allow federated models to be hosted and viewed for a more ‘up-to-date’ collaboration workflow.
IFC Guidance
To ensure effective collaboration between the multiple parties a series of trail/test IFC (International Foundation Class) exports will be scheduled. The export shall contain IFC objects for all discipline specific objects to be produced by each respective BIM author.
IFC File Export Settings
Following a successful IFC exchange trial each BIM author must specify their IFC export settings. These settings should be shared under Appendix P – BIM Guides.
Data Reviews
Data entry will be an ongoing process throughout the project, it will be carefully controlled with regular in-house data checks carried out by each discipline. Checks to include;
Project data parameters have been correctly input. As a minimum the following information shall be contained within the model:
Family correctly assigned.
Type
Level
Ref. to the type specific data in the Specification if that data is not otherwise embedded
Any other information specified in the Model Production Delivery Table
Organization contact details are correct and up to date
No data amendments once extracted from the 3D models
Data has been entered in the correct fields and format (e.g. alphanumeric)
Data has been entered at the correct type/instance level
Model and project protocols have been followed (naming conventions, levels etc.)
Duplicate objects removed from the models
The responsibility for correct data lies with the model in the same way as the responsibility for providing the correct geometry. However, the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) will conduct periodic data audits and issue reports documenting the results.
PROJECT WORKSHARING & COLLABORATION
Collaboration is vital to the success of a BIM Project. There are two aspects to collaboration; communication between people (under Meetings in Section 8.6), and the control and sharing of the project information and data described in the following sections.
Model Collaboration
As part of BIM, the design shall be authored using BIM software collaboratively and in real time. Where work is performed in multiple offices or where subcontractors and suppliers are major participants in the BIM, the Consultants will facilitate the maximize “live” collaboration practicably possible and minimize the frequency and time lag of BIM updates to the Consultant’s master BIM from external participants. The BIM shall not be created at the end of the project only to meet project deliverables.
The Model Collaboration process will utilize the Autodesk BIM 360 platform – Design Collaboration module. It should follow the Appendix M – BIM Timeline.
BIM360 Package Exchange
The Work in Progress models should be shared by using BIM360 platform – Design Collaboration module. For a better understanding of the package exchanged, a naming convention should be used based in the following table:
Program & Project Code
This is a six-character indicating the Program Code and the Project Code.
Originator Code
An alphabetic code that represents the company responsible for that aspect of the work. The codes must represent the company name, and not the discipline – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Discipline / Role
This a two-character indicating the discipline. Refer to the Red Sea Naming Convention displayed in the PMIS Manual.
Package Exchange Code
The Package Exchange Code utilize the ISO 19650 Suitability Code (extracted from BS1192:2007+A2:2016), to define the status of the shared documents and Models between stakeholders.
Volume Code
Two alphanumeric characters that relate to spatial sub-division of the project starting with Volume or System; ZZ is applied when all volumes are referred to – see sub-topic 6.5 File Naming Conventions.
Sequence Number
Four digits sequential number – leading zeros should be used.
Common Data Environment & PMIS
The Common Data Environment is the working environment where all current, controlled project design information is stored and made available by controlled access. It is normally an application or group of applications that form the “single source of truth” for the building information.
A Common Data Environment (CDE) approach allows information to be shared effectively between all members of the project team; giving early access to information and avoiding risk of duplication. For this project Aconex and BIM 360 shall be the designated CDE’s.
BIM 360 will be utilized for all design related information which includes model uploads, PDFs and native design files. The following 3D views are required to be published on BIM 360:
One that contains only the discipline elements
Second that contains the federated model
Third that is tailored for export purposes that free of elements duplication between various design disciplines.
Aconex for other documentation such as word documents can be used as a check but formats unrelated to modelled information.
There are four main environments:
WIP (Work in Progress) – CDE
The working area within an organization’s own systems.
SHARED – CDE
The models that are regularly shared for use of entire project team. The Executive Architect will federate all models and the Task Information Manager contact from each organization will ensure all the latest relevant models are downloaded and federated into their WIP files.
All team members should be using other parties’ information for their own internal coordination checks. To progress to the next stage the information must be authorized by the appropriate person.
PUBLISHED – TRSDC PMIS
This information will have been accepted by the nominated party, in which case it will be suitable for tender or construction (2D model output only)
ARCHIVE – TRSDC PMIS
History of project information stored within the CDE.
Please refer to the BIM 360 User Guides and PMIS Manual for more information on folder structures and interaction with the systems.
Model Upload Process
3D models must be shared at regular intervals to ensure the rest of the project team are coordinating with the latest information. This should happen following TRSDC BIM360 set-up environment.
BIM Models Exchange
Depending on which BIM Model format, the process of exchanging the information across all teams is different.
Revit Models Exchange
All native models should be exchanged using the Collaboration Pro module in BIM360 on a weekly basis. A proper naming convention should be followed – please refer to sub-topic 8.1.1 BIM360 Package Exchange. All consultants should be adding a description informing the major changes.
As the Interior Design consultants doesn´t have access to the Collaboration Pro module, Revit models must be exchanged manually. By having the models workshared in the work in progress folder – 01_WIP – all models should be copied into the folder by using the BIM360 feature: 02_SHARED>Asset folder>Discipline folder. Along with the Exchange, a communication should be sent out to all consultants informing the major changes.
All consultants should access to the 02_SHARED>Asset folder>Discipline folder and do a copy of the models into the Consumed folder: 01_WIP>Discipline folder>Consumed>HW3_06_ID-Interior Design – this folder should be created manually.
NWC and NWD Models Exchange
All Revit models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides – and uploaded manually into a folder in BIM360 located at: 03_SUBMISSIONS>01_OnGoing Design Coordination>12_IM-Information Management>Asset folder>weekly folder>NWC>Discipline folder.
DWFx Models Exchange
All DWF models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides – and uploaded manually into a folder located at: 03_SUBMISSIONS>01_OnGoing Design Coordination>12_IM-Information Management>Asset folder>weekly folder>NWFx>Discipline folder.
It´s required that the DWFx models contains 70% of the Omniclass codes included – please refer to APPENDIX J – Master Information Delivery Plan.
IFC Models Exchange
All IFC models should be exported following the requirements needed – please refer to APPENDIX P – BIM Guides. These models are only required to be exchanged on a gate submission and should be followed the workflow in place for the submissions.
BIM Models should be shared according to the table below:
Software Usage
The following list only includes the software that is required to be compatible with the Client’s systems and will form part of the deliverables. These file formats will form the basis of coordination between all disciplines. All other software required for the project, including version, shall be agreed by each discipline in coordination with all parties. The versions are those agreed at project inception. Upgrades to subsequent versions of the software after commencement of the project shall be subject to agreement by TRSDC, in which case will occur at an agreed designated stage of the project and documented accordingly in this section.
<For Revit Based projects, all disciplines MUST use the same version of Autodesk Revit, outlined above. For software updates, all parties must agree for upgrade. Software type can be determined by the EIR’s >
Clash Rendition Viewer
The clash rendition viewer to be used across the whole project.
BIM Meetings
A BIM Kick-off meeting will be held with all known supply chain members in order to run through the BIM deliverables for the project. This will directly reference the EIR and the processes for delivering BIM for the project. This meeting will be chaired by the Project Information Manger (Appointing Party) and Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) who will attend all related team meetings.
This will then be followed by a meeting with all Task Information Managers from all project teams to go through the first draft of the BEP in a collaborative round table discussion and with agreement from all by its conclusion.
Moving forward; regular BIM meetings summarized below will commence with all Task Information Managers present from all relevant project team organizations. If not feasible for members of the project team to attend, then it is the team member’s responsibility to ensure arrangements are made for their members to still be in attendance through communication means.
The BIM related meeting plan will be developed by the Task Information Manger – Lead (Lead Appointed Party) and the Interface Manager. The Design Coordination meeting frequency will vary through the contract period but in general will follow a weekly review or upon request for each of the Design Managers.
Summary of Meetings:
Clash Detection and Coordination Meetings Schedule
The Clash Detection and Coordination Meetings will take place on a biweekly basis or as per client request. In order for this to happen there are several tasks that are required to be completed by each design consultant. The actual days will be confirmed, but the following cycle is intended to be followed.
Outlined below is the fortnightly plan of actions. This will be updated once the design coordination meeting schedule has been agreed.
The following table has been filled out indicatively. Please omit or amend sections to follow project specific requirements. Please remove this text following any changes.
MODEL REVIEWS
Quality Control Procedures
Model audits are to be carried out regularly on the shared models for their compliance with this [BEP]. The process involves a combination of checks listed below to ensure there are no unresolved issues during construction or any significant loss of data upon transfer of as-built models and record documents at facility handover.
Clash Detection Process Overview
Automated clash detection is to be viewed as the last line of defense – it is always preferable to avoid unmanaged clashes through considered modelling than to rely on clash detection to identify and then resolve them.
Each BIM participant is responsible to maintain the integrity of the models and information and check/review these with their team manager as part of standard model collaboration before issuing to the SHARED part of the CDE.
If a clash is detected, according to the LOD per stage, that cannot be resolved by the construction, consultant and subcontracting team then the lead designer shall be involved in the discussion to reach an agreed solution. Individual subcontractors and consultants are responsible for making changes to their own model(s) only, and where/if required.
Automated clash detection of single discipline models is to be carried out by Task Team Information Managers at all project stages on a >specify frequency< basis using Navisworks Manage or similar software, by implementing the clash rules defined in >insert doc reference<. This is to ensure that coordination is proceeding as expected, and to give early warning of any common issues.
The individual shared models shall be combined for design review and clash detection by the Executive Architect and a federated model shall be made available in read only format to the whole team for model-based reviews and coordination throughout the project lifecycle and issued on to a shared area of the CDE.
Automated clash detection on the federated model will be carried out ahead of each BIM Workshop by the Executive Architect on behalf of the Client as the models are updated. The clash rules defined in >insert doc reference< allows us to efficiently break down clash results and clashes across models and different work packages. This is then broken up by buildings and floors within the site, allowing us to further focus on specific areas aligning with the critical path of the project program for construction to ensure delivery of the project is kept on track.
Automated Clash reports (Grouping of clashes) and any coordination reports will be created and issued to supplement the read only combined model and SHARED on the CDE.
Specialist clash detection should be discussed, costed with an agreed output prior to the project starting. Health and safety/CDM management
BIM and the CDE should support the management of health and safety and CDM requirements. The CDM meetings are to be integral with the BIM Modelling review process and are to be model based. This is to ensure that compliance with CDM is incorporated as part of the spatial design and modelling process. The review process is to include all relevant project teams to ensure the CDM requirements are met. The interactive coordination workshops allow Health and Safety issues to be visualized and a coordinated mitigation established. Integration of BIM can be incorporated into on-site toolbox talks and site inductions.
9.3 Responsibilities and Requirements
Each consultant will ensure that, they are using correct 3d view and Navisworks options editor setting for exporting any NWC files, KAA already provide the NWC export settings.
All consultant need to share their NWC files
Khatib and Alami will create NWC files for BOH
All consultants are responsible for submit a federated NWD file on a weekly basis.
Any NWC file naming changes should be inform Khatib and Alami and approved with TRSDC immediately with a proper mapping strategy,
All consultants are responsible for correct NWC building coordinates. If a building have multiple site position, we should all follow the architectural file export location,
All consultants can check the NWC file tracker for rectify their pending issues that uploaded on BIM360
Khatib and Alami will run clash detection and upload federated Navisworks models in BIM360,
All consultants are responsible to solve their own clashes,
Currently building are combine with respect of Volume/ System information of each assets and clash detection information will be built within this Naviswork model. Additionally each assets overall federated model are generated for design review.
9.4 Weekly Model Sharing & Clash Detection Road Map
All Navisworks models are shared on a weekly basis in BIM360 by the consultants. Those models will be used to run clash detection analysis.
All disciplines model mapping,
Clash detection life cycle,
9.5 Clash Detection Criteria
Discipline clashes are prioritized based on categories sets. Clash tolerance value are change when design reaches to next stage.
Type of Clashes
Hard Clash\Duplicated elements
Soft Clash\Clearance Clash
Hard clash\Duplicated elements
When two objects occupying the same space, it will be considered as a hard clash. For example, a duct placed where a beam designed or, a number of pipe running through a structural wall. Duplicated elements can show in the report and that’s when two elements had been placed in the same places which causes double count and generates a clash. For example, structural column copied on top of each other.
Soft clash\clearance refers to objects that demand certain spatial/geometric tolerances or buffers having objects within their buffer zone of access, insulation, maintenance or safety. For example, equipment placed in an unaccusable zone, access zones for maintenance of MEP systems.
9.6 Matrix and Tolerance
Current clash matrix are using discipline clash method,
Recent clash detective schedule are presenting “Discipline A” vs “Discipline B” a detail matrix with clash tolerance. Each face of the design, KA will be update the stage code and Tolerance. Currently KA is using 50mm tolerance.
9.7 Clash Detection Rules
Below is an example of the type of clash detection rules and tolerances that may be undertaken.
Note: All grey highlighted clashes will be managed by consultants.
Note: Foster + Partners to share Clash tolerances as per previous TRSDC projects based on Stages.

The shall update this section to incorporate method and responsibilities for the creation of an as built 3D information model.
Structured asset information
Structured asset information is to be delivered in accordance with BS 1192-4:2014 (COBie) and contained within a single Information Container when issued at information exchange milestones.
The requirements for asset information are as detailed in Appendix H, section of the EIR. Task Teams will populate non-geometric information for components within their design/construction scope or as otherwise defined by the Detailed (BIM) Responsibility Matrix, Appendix C where they appear as a maintainable asset within Appendix H, section of the EIR.
Where a Task Team are using Autodesk Revit as their primary BIM authoring software, they will use the Autodesk BIM interoperability tool add-on to general COBie parameters for population. This add-on is available to download from the following location.
It is imperative that this tool is run at the beginning of the project. To ensure information consistency The Design Lead Appointed Party shall issue a standardised setup file, made available at the following location.
Where a Task Team are not using Autodesk Revit, they shall manually create and populate parameters within their 3D information model(s) that match exactly the attribute names contained within Appendix H, section of the EIR.
Transfer of design/construction responsibility between Task Teams
Where responsibility for components transfers between task teams, the following processes shall be applied as relevant.
Recipient task team makes Geometric changes: Component ID shall be updated to reflect recipient task team.
Recipient task team makes Non-geometric changes: COBie.CreatedBy attribute shall be updated to recipient task team. Component ID shall not change.

INFORMATION PRODUCTION METHODS AND PROCEDURES
Common Data Environment
Table : Details of the Common Data Environment
The purpose of the CDE is to provide and Project Stakeholders with a secure, central, accessible resource for collecting, managing and disseminating each information container through a managed process. A CDE ‘workflow’ describes the processes to be used and a CDE “solution” can provide the technology to support those processes.
On this project, the current CDE is owned by . The CDE will be the repository for the PIM for the project lifecycle. The Lead Appointing Party CDE Information Manager has established the project’s common data environment (CDE) to serve the overall requirements of the project and to support the collaborative production of information.
Project Stakeholders are responsible for storing and maintaining a copy of all their project information in a secure, stable location within their own organisation and must make information available if requested, over the CDE. must have access to both native and exchange information models stored in the CDE at any point during the project.
As per the requirement contained within the EIR models must be issued within three working days of an RFI requesting this information.
Trialling of the CDE
To trial the exchange of information models, the Lead Appointed Party will facilitate the initial sharing and linking of project models issued via the CDE. The process for this will be as follows.
The Lead Appointed Party will generate a ‘Shared levels and grids’ model as per section 8.3.1
The Lead Appointed Party will issue their model in both native format and exchange information format using the shared CDE workflow
All task teams will access the ‘Shared levels and grid’ model and use this as a reference to create their own information model
All task teams will issue their information models to the CDE using the shared workflow.
Upon completion of the trial(s) the Lead Appointed Party and Appointing Party Information Manager will report outcomes to the Appointing Party CDE Information Manager.
Collaboration process
BIM Meetings
To establish and maintain a collaborative environment the following meetings have been identified. The Lead Appointed Party will notify via email invite any individuals required to attend.
Table : BIM meetings
Coordination and clash detection process
All task teams are to issue models a minimum of five working days prior to Design Team/BIM Coordination meetings.
Coordination and clash detection
All task teams are responsible for clash detecting their own models prior to issue in accordance with the requirements of the Information Delivery Strategy. The table below details individual’s responsibility to delivery of a ‘clash free’ Project Information Model.
Table : Clash detection and resolution responsibilities
Coordination and clash detection rulesets
To ensure compliance with the project’s Key Performance Indicators the following rulesets have been agreed by the Appointing Party and Delivery Team

Survey
Where task teams are required to, or otherwise capture existing condition information, either via traditional measurement, laser capture or otherwise, task teams shall follow the guidance set out in BS 5964-3:1996.
To ensure captured survey data is coordinated and useable, task teams shall comply with the format below;
Table : Defined survey formats
FEDERATION STRATEGY
Information breakdown strategy
The table below defines the strategy for how the PIM shall be divided into sets of information containers. This shall be updated as new task teams are appointed.
Table : Information breakdown strategy
Note: Individual information models must not exceed 250mb to ensure that file sizes are practical for upload and download with the specified IT infrastructure. Where a task team’s information model is at risk of exceeding this limit they shall notify the Appointed Party CDE Information Manager, Appointing Party Information Manager and Appointing Party and respond with any mitigating actions deemed necessary.
Federation process
The Design Lead Appointed Party is responsible for accessing information provided by all task teams and federating their 3D information models into a single multidisciplinary information model. Upon their appointment the Construction Lead will acquire this responsibility. As a minimum requirement, the federated model will be updated monthly and issued onto the CDE throughout the project duration unless explicitly agreed with the .
The federation process will be as follows;
The responsible party will create a federate model using the exchange format information models uploaded to the CDE
The federated model will be created using the software outlined in section 10.1 with the resultant file published to the CDE.
SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE
Software
The agreed software, version and service pack for each discipline are as defined below. Only software identified below shall be used to author, coordinate and validate information models. Any update is to be explicitly agreed by the Appointing Party and Appointing Party Information Manager.
Table : Agreed software
Hardware and IT Infrastructure
All Project Stakeholders shall deploy hardware and IT infrastructure appropriate to the fulfilment of the Exchange Information Requirements and this BIM Execution Plan.
This shall be achieved as each Project Stakeholder sees fit, with consideration to the project’s methods and procedures, technical requirements, and security requirements.

Template history
Template governance
This BIM Execution Plan (BEP) template will be reviewed and updated from time to time to support continual development and change within Google. Trigger events to initiate review and update shall be, but not limited to those contained within the table below. Google shall assess impact of changes to the BIM Execution Plan, with consideration of the downstream influence on current projects.
GUIDANCE
Google has provided the ‘BIM Execution Plan template’ to support the Lead Appointed Party, and their Delivery Team.
The aim of providing a BIM Execution Plan template is to enable consistency on a project between all Lead Appointed Parties. The sections of this template must not be changed, rather crossed through if not being utilized, this is to enable the Appointing Party and their Appointing Party Information Manager to align to their information requirements.
The Appointing Party is likely to have several appointments with Lead Appointed Parties (for example, for architecture, engineering, project management and construction), and a Lead Appointed Party is likely to have several appointments with Appointed Parties (especially where they are a general contractor), it is therefore expected for several BIM Execution Plans to be in place on a project. The diagram on the following page demonstrates two typical scenarios for this.
Where notes appear like [THIS], the Appointing Party Information Manager should input the relevant information prior to issuing the BIM Execution Plan template to the new Lead Appointed Party.
Where notes appear like [THIS], the author of the BIM Execution Plan should input the relevant information. The entire BIM Execution Plan template should be reviewed in detail before submission.
For the BIM Execution Plan Google has provided additional templates to supplement, as below:

BIM Execution Plan - ISO 19650 Compliant
Executive Summary
The BEP is a process management document which defines the process for an Owner and Delivery Team Members to develop a Project BIM Execution Plan. This BEP outlines the strategic approach to information management throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring compliance with ISO 19650 standards and the Employer's Information Requirements (EIR). The document establishes clear protocols for model development, data exchange, and collaborative workflows within the Common Data Environment (CDE).
The primary objectives of this BEP include establishing a robust framework for information delivery, defining roles and responsibilities across the project team, implementing quality assurance procedures, and ensuring seamless coordination between all appointed parties. This plan responds directly to the EIR, noting the proposed strategic objectives of both the Employer and the project activities to be undertaken.
Project Information Overview
This project requires comprehensive BIM implementation across all design and construction phases. The Delivery Team shall produce coordinated federated models at key project milestones, incorporating architectural, structural, MEP, and civil engineering disciplines. Information shall be delivered in accordance with the agreed Information Delivery Plan, with specific emphasis on data quality, consistency, and compliance with UK BIM Framework standards.
The project team will utilize industry-standard BIM authoring tools including Autodesk Revit for architectural and MEP design, Tekla Structures for structural engineering, and Civil 3D for civil infrastructure. All models must be developed to the Level of Information Need specified for each project stage, ensuring appropriate geometric and alphanumeric detail.
BIM Uses and Objectives
The following BIM uses have been identified as essential for project delivery: 3D coordination to identify and resolve spatial conflicts prior to construction, 4D sequencing for construction planning and logistics coordination, 5D cost estimation linked to model elements, design authoring across all disciplines, and As-Built documentation for facilities management handover.
Additional BIM uses include energy analysis to validate sustainability targets, structural analysis integration, lighting analysis, code compliance validation, and asset information modeling for operational phase requirements. Each BIM use shall be executed in accordance with documented procedures and quality control checkpoints.
Roles and Responsibilities
The Information Manager serves as the primary coordinator for all information management activities, ensuring compliance with the BEP and ISO 19650 standards. The Information Manager chairs coordination meetings, reviews model submissions for compliance, manages the CDE workflow, and reports on information delivery progress to the project board.
Lead Appointed Party responsibilities include overall project BIM coordination, federated model creation and maintenance, clash detection and resolution coordination, and ensuring timely information delivery by all appointed parties. The Lead Appointed Party must ensure all deliverables meet the Employer's requirements and comply with agreed standards.
Task Team responsibilities include developing discipline-specific models to agreed standards, participating in coordination meetings, resolving assigned clashes and design issues, submitting information according to the agreed schedule, and maintaining model quality throughout the project lifecycle. Each Task Team must designate a Task Information Manager responsible for information quality within their discipline.
Collaboration Procedures and Workflows
All project information shall be managed through an ISO 19650 compliant Common Data Environment with clearly defined information containers for each discipline and project phase. The CDE workflow comprises four key states: Work in Progress (WIP) for active development, Shared for coordination and review, Published for approved information, and Archive for superseded information.
Model coordination meetings shall occur bi-weekly during design development phases, with increased frequency during critical coordination periods. All appointed parties must submit models to the Shared area at least 48 hours prior to coordination meetings to allow adequate review time. Clash detection reports must be distributed within 24 hours of coordination meetings, with assigned parties responsible for resolution within agreed timeframes.
Information exchange protocols require all model submissions to include native file formats, IFC exports for coordination, and PDF documentation for review purposes. Metadata requirements include project code, originator code, volume/system identifier, level/location, document type, role, and classification according to Uniclass 2015 taxonomy.
Model Requirements and Data Standards
All BIM models must be developed using project-specific templates incorporating agreed naming conventions, classification systems, and level of information need specifications. Geometric modeling shall follow established LOD (Level of Development) criteria appropriate to each project stage, ensuring models contain sufficient detail for their intended purpose without excessive information that could impact performance.
Alphanumeric information attached to model elements must comply with the project's data schema, incorporating mandatory parameters for asset identification, specification references, maintenance requirements, and warranty information. COBie-compliant data must be embedded within models to facilitate seamless handover to facilities management systems.
Model file naming shall follow the structure: PRJ-ORIG-VOL-LVL-TYPE-ROLE-CLASS-NUMBER, where each component is clearly defined in the project naming convention standard. This ensures consistent file identification across all disciplines and project phases.
Quality Assurance and Validation
Quality control procedures include automated model checking against project standards using validation software, manual design reviews at defined hold points, and peer review processes for complex design elements. Each model submission must be accompanied by a quality control checklist confirming compliance with technical standards.
Validation checks include geometry validation to identify modeling errors, classification verification ensuring correct Uniclass coding, data completeness checks confirming all required parameters are populated, and clash detection across federated models. Models failing validation criteria will be rejected and returned to the originating party for correction.
Information Delivery Planning
The Master Information Delivery Plan (MIDP) establishes the overarching schedule for information delivery across all project stages, aligned with RIBA Plan of Work stages and contractual milestones. The MIDP identifies key decision points requiring specific information deliverables and coordinates inputs from all appointed parties.
Task Information Delivery Plans (TIDPs) detail discipline-specific deliverables, including model files, drawings, specifications, schedules, and data sets. Each TIDP specifies the information container, format, level of information need, responsible party, and delivery date for each deliverable. TIDPs must be maintained and updated throughout the project to reflect approved changes to scope or schedule.
Key information delivery milestones include Stage 3 Developed Design submission with spatially coordinated models, Stage 4 Technical Design with construction-ready information, Stage 5 As-Built documentation reflecting constructed conditions, and Stage 6 Handover with complete O&M information and COBie data sets.
Technology and Software Standards
The project team shall utilize the following BIM authoring platforms: Autodesk Revit 2023 or later for architectural and MEP disciplines, Tekla Structures 2023 or later for structural engineering, Autodesk Civil 3D 2023 for civil infrastructure, and Navisworks Manage 2023 for coordination and clash detection.
All models must be capable of exporting IFC 2x3 or IFC4 files for coordination purposes, ensuring interoperability across different software platforms. The project coordinate system shall be established using Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinates, with agreed project origin and orientation documented in the BEP appendices.
Cloud-based collaboration platforms include Autodesk Construction Cloud for CDE functionality, document management, and model coordination. All project stakeholders must have appropriate access permissions configured by the Information Manager based on their role and information needs.
Health and Safety Information Management
BIM models shall incorporate health and safety information relevant to design risk assessments and construction planning. Identified hazards must be clearly documented within model elements using designated parameters, with links to detailed risk assessments and mitigation measures in the project health and safety file.
Construction sequencing models (4D) must consider temporary works requirements, access constraints, and high-risk activities. The Principal Designer shall review BIM models to verify adequate consideration of health and safety risks and ensure compliance with CDM regulations.
As-Built and Handover Requirements
As-Built models must accurately represent constructed conditions, incorporating all approved design changes and site variations. The construction team is responsible for maintaining As-Built model accuracy throughout the construction phase, with updates required within two weeks of significant changes.
COBie data shall be progressively populated throughout design and construction phases, with final validation prior to handover. Required COBie sheets include Facility, Floor, Space, Zone, Type, Component, System, Assembly, Connection, Spare, Resource, Job, and Document. All COBie data must pass validation against the COBie UK 2012 schema.
Handover deliverables include native BIM models, IFC exports, COBie data sets, O&M documentation linked to model elements, asset registers, and comprehensive as-built drawings. The Employer's facilities management team must confirm acceptance of all handover information prior to project closeout.
Post-Handover Asset Information Management
The Employer shall utilize delivered asset information within their Computer-Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) system for ongoing operations and maintenance activities. BIM models and associated data will support space management, preventive maintenance scheduling, energy monitoring, and future refurbishment planning.
The Information Manager shall coordinate handover training sessions for the Employer's facilities team, ensuring they understand how to access, navigate, and utilize delivered BIM information effectively. Documentation must include user guides, data schemas, and contact information for ongoing technical support.
