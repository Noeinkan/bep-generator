Where authoring applications allow for grouping of attributes, ‘Data (Type)’ shall be used for type information and ‘Data’ for instance information.
Level of Information Need shall not exceed that required
As built 3D information model
The  shall update this section to incorporate method and responsibilities for the creation of an as built 3D information model.
Structured asset information 
Structured asset information is to be delivered in accordance with BS 1192-4:2014 (COBie) and contained within a single Information Container when issued at information exchange milestones. 
The requirements for asset information are as detailed in Appendix H, section  of the EIR. Task Teams will populate non-geometric information for components within their design/construction scope or as otherwise defined by the Detailed (BIM) Responsibility Matrix, Appendix C where they appear as a maintainable asset within Appendix H, section  of the EIR.
Where a Task Team are using Autodesk Revit as their primary BIM authoring software, they will use the Autodesk BIM interoperability tool add-on to general COBie parameters for population. This add-on is available to download from the following location.
It is imperative that this tool is run at the beginning of the project. To ensure information consistency The Design Lead Appointed Party shall issue a standardised setup file, made available at the following location.
Where a Task Team are not using Autodesk Revit, they shall manually create and populate parameters within their 3D information model(s) that match exactly the attribute names contained within Appendix H, section  of the EIR.
Transfer of design/construction responsibility between Task Teams
Where responsibility for components transfers between task teams, the following processes shall be applied as relevant.
Recipient task team makes Geometric changes: Component ID shall be updated to reflect recipient task team.
Recipient task team makes Non-geometric changes: COBie.CreatedBy attribute shall be updated to recipient task team. Component ID shall not change.
Recipient task team makes Geometric and non-geometric changes: COBie.CreatedBy attribute shall be updated to recipient task team. Component ID shall be updated to reflect recipient task team.
Additional non-geometric information
Performance information
The requirements for performance information are as detailed in Appendix H, section of the EIR. Task Teams will populate non-geometric information for components within their design/construction scope or as otherwise defined by the Detailed (BIM) Responsibility Matrix, Appendix C where they appear as a maintainable asset within Appendix H, section of the EIR.
Task Team shall manually create and populate parameters within their 3D information model(s) that match exactly the attribute names contained within Appendix H, section of the EIR.

As per EIR section 7.2.3, the Design Lead (Appointed Party) during the design stages, and the  upon appointment, will undertake a review of the information models shared by each Task Team in accordance with the project’s information production methods and procedures.
In doing this, the Design/ will consider:
The Information Identification integrity – Information Container is checked for correct identification (ID) as defined in section 6.2 of the EIR
Compliance with the project Federation Strategy - Information Container is analysed to check that it has been appropriately divided into sets of information containers keeping the individual Information Container size under the 0mb limit specified in section 7.3 of the EIR
Compliance with BIM object authoring requirements – Information Container is analysed to check that BIM objects have been authored in accordance with section 6.2.2 of the EIR
The progression of the design and design information - Information Container is analysed to check for compliance with the level of information need required at a particular project stage. The development, completeness and validity of geometrical and non-geometrical information is reviewed against the Detailed BIM Responsibility Matrix
The development, completeness and validity of asset information which will be reviewed against the Asset Information Requirements 
The development, completeness, and validity of the classification information within the Information Container, which will be reviewed against the requirements defined in section 6.3 of the EIR

INFORMATION PRODUCTION METHODS AND PROCEDURES
Common Data Environment
Table : Details of the Common Data Environment
The purpose of the CDE is to provide  and Project Stakeholders with a secure, central, accessible resource for collecting, managing and disseminating each information container through a managed process. A CDE ‘workflow’ describes the processes to be used and a CDE “solution” can provide the technology to support those processes. 
On this project, the current CDE is owned by . The CDE will be the repository for the PIM for the project lifecycle. The Lead Appointing Party CDE Information Manager has established the project’s common data environment (CDE) to serve the overall requirements of the project and to support the collaborative production of information. 
Project Stakeholders are responsible for storing and maintaining a copy of all their project information in a secure, stable location within their own organisation and must make information available if requested, over the CDE.  must have access to both native and exchange information models stored in the CDE at any point during the project. 
As per the requirement contained within the EIR models must be issued within three working days of an RFI requesting this information.
Trialling of the CDE
To trial the exchange of information models, the Lead Appointed Party will facilitate the initial sharing and linking of project models issued via the CDE. The process for this will be as follows.
The Lead Appointed Party will generate a ‘Shared levels and grids’ model as per section 8.3.1
The Lead Appointed Party will issue their model in both native format and exchange information format using the shared CDE workflow
All task teams will access the ‘Shared levels and grid’ model and use this as a reference to create their own information model
All task teams will issue their information models to the CDE using the shared workflow.
Upon completion of the trial(s) the Lead Appointed Party and Appointing Party Information Manager will report outcomes to the Appointing Party CDE Information Manager.
Collaboration process
