Template history
Template governance
This BIM Execution Plan (BEP) template will be reviewed and updated from time to time to support continual development and change within Google. Trigger events to initiate review and update shall be, but not limited to those contained within the table below. Google shall assess impact of changes to the BIM Execution Plan, with consideration of the downstream influence on current projects.
GUIDANCE
Google has provided the ‘BIM Execution Plan template’ to support the Lead Appointed Party, and their Delivery Team.
The aim of providing a BIM Execution Plan template is to enable consistency on a project between all Lead Appointed Parties. The sections of this template must not be changed, rather crossed through if not being utilized, this is to enable the Appointing Party and their Appointing Party Information Manager to align to their information requirements.
The Appointing Party is likely to have several appointments with Lead Appointed Parties (for example, for architecture, engineering, project management and construction), and a Lead Appointed Party is likely to have several appointments with Appointed Parties (especially where they are a general contractor), it is therefore expected for several BIM Execution Plans to be in place on a project. The diagram on the following page demonstrates two typical scenarios for this.
Where notes appear like [THIS], the Appointing Party Information Manager should input the relevant information prior to issuing the BIM Execution Plan template to the new Lead Appointed Party.
Where notes appear like [THIS], the author of the BIM Execution Plan should input the relevant information. The entire BIM Execution Plan template should be reviewed in detail before submission.
For the BIM Execution Plan Google has provided additional templates to supplement, as below:

1	Introduction
This document is the BIM Execution Plan (BEP) produced by [insert Lead Appointed Party name] to convey the Delivery Team’s approach to Information Management using Building Information Modeling (BIM) on [insert project name]. This document is intended as a succinct delivery resource, which the Delivery Team will use alongside other resources to produce, manage and exchange project information throughout their appointment.
As shown in figure 1 this BIM Execution Plan is a formal appointment resource that responds directly to Google's need for information for this project, as communicated through the Exchange Information Requirements, Part A [Insert link once completed] and Project Information Requirements, Part A [Insert link once completed]. Similarly the BIM Execution Plan confirms any agreed amendments and additions to Google’s Information Standard and Information Production Methods and Procedures which the Delivery Team requires for their own purposes.
Figure 1: Relationship between the project’s information requirements, Information Standard, Information Production Methods and Procedures and the Delivery Team’s agreed response to these documents
1.1	Who uses the BIM Execution Plan?
The agreed BIM Execution Plan shall be used by the Lead Appointed Party’s Delivery Team as a resource to produce, manage and exchange information in a manner that Google and the project team have agreed is suitable. 
Each task team will use their Delivery Team’s BIM Execution Plan to help understand their information management functions, information responsibilities, and their agreed information delivery strategy. The BIM Execution Plan also signposts to other delivery resources and tools that task teams will find useful as listed below;
Agreed Information Standard
Agreed Information Production Methods and Procedures
Master Information Delivery Plan (MIDP)
Delivery Team’s information risk register
Mobilization plan
Additionally the BIM Execution Plan explains the Lead Appointed Party’s federation strategy to all other project stakeholders.
[A BIM Execution Plan must be provided for each direct appointment to the Appointing Party.]

4.1	Detailed Responsibility Matrix
[The Lead Appointed Party shall further refine the Delivery Team’s high-level responsibility matrix to establish the detailed responsibility matrix, which identifies:
What information is to be produced
When the information is to be exchanged and with whom; and

The [Detailed Responsibility Matrix, insert link] outlines the allocated responsibility for each element of the information model and the key deliverables associated to each element.
4.2	Master Information Delivery Plan
[The Lead Appointed Party shall aggregate the task information delivery plans (TIDPs) from each task team to establish the Delivery Team’s master information delivery plan (MIDP). In doing this, the Lead Appointed Party shall consider:

the information predecessors or dependencies on information between task teams
the time the Lead Appointed Party will need to review and authorize the information model
the time the appointing party will need to review and accept the information model. 
Once the Master Information Delivery Plan has been established, the Lead Appointed Party shall: 
baseline the deliverables and dates within the Master Information Delivery Plan
inform each task team and notify if any changes are required to the Task Information Delivery Plan
inform the appointing party of any risks or issues which could impact on the project’s information delivery milestones]
The [Master Information Delivery Plan, insert link] lists all information containers to be produced throughout the project, the associated responsibilities and information exchange milestones.
