Purpose of this document
Using the Queensland Health Project Information Requirements (PIR), this Design Building Information Modelling (BIM) Execution Plan (DBEP) template is to be populated in Microsoft Word by the tendering Delivery Team for the named project. 
Track changes must be used to highlight any changes between the original document and all subsequent revisions. Once agreed by the Delivery Team and Queensland Health, accept changes and record a summary in the version history table on page 3.
The DBEP must outline the Delivery Team’s proposed approach to using BIM/s and information management practices for the design stages the Delivery Team are engaged to perform. Before the start of a new major stage (Schematic Design, Detailed Design, Construction Documentation, etc.) the DBEP shall be reviewed, revised and agreed with the Queensland Health Project Management, confirming the approach for that stage.
The design BIM/s will be used by other Appointed Parties such as the Quantity Surveyor (QS) for costing and Contractor to inform the tender and construction, ultimately the production of as-built BIM/s containing asset data for the project will be handed over to the Hospital and Health Service (HHS). 
The Delivery Team is to use any of the following information sources to assist in the creation of this document:
Queensland Health Capital Infrastructure Requirements (CIR)
Queensland Health PIR for BIM
Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists 
Queensland Health BIM Data Uploader Template 
Any existing conditions HHS BIM/s
Existing 2D drawings, reports and schedules
Survey information including laser scans 
HHS critical Asset Information Requirements (e.g. naming, coding, classifications) 
Functional Design Brief and any space planning information
AusHFG codes and guidelines 
The DBEP must be developed by the proposed BIM Manager, taking into consideration the needs of the Delivery Team and Queensland Health PIR and CIR. The DBEP will be used as part of the assessment criteria for determining a preferred Delivery Team for design stages. 
The DBEP will always be created prior to the development of the Construction BEP (CBEP). The DBEP and federated model will be used by tendering Contractors to inform the development of the CBEP and construction BIM/s.
Document structure
The document is divided up into Commercial, Managerial and Technical sections in alignment with ISO 19650. The Managerial section is further split into the logical project delivery stages. In this way, Appointed Parties can work through the project delivery stages, understanding the specific BIM requirements for each discipline for the given stage. 
This document articulates how information shall be structured, managed and delivered by each Appointed Party contracted by Queensland Health, in alignment with the PIR.
As changes during project delivery are inevitable, such as new Delivery Team members joining the project, the BEP shall be revised by the BIM Manager when any new Appointed Party joins the project and/or before each new project stage commences.

Overview
For Detailed Design onwards the BIM/s must contain the requirements of the previous project stages above and incorporate the following:
The design and documentation across all design disciplines, unless otherwise agreed and documented in this DBEP, must use a BIM authoring tool capable of producing the required output data (IFC 2x 3 or later) and documentation as specified for all project deliverables
All Queensland Health parameters (refer to Queensland Health Project Schedules (Revit)_2021 or Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters) must be added to BIM/s if not previously done

This process, including the process, documentation and reporting of detection and resolution outcomes, is to be clearly articulated in Section 6.9 of the DBEP and reported to the Queensland Health Project Management at nominated intervals
Where existing buildings and/or structures are within the modelling boundary, traditional 2D documentation may be acceptable for some elements by agreement with Queensland Health and documented in Section 5.4
Where a design will interface with an existing building or structure, a laser scan survey of the existing building or structure, to which new elements may interface, may be procured as directed by Queensland Health. If procured, the laser scan survey must be used for coordination and made available to all consultants in a format that integrates with the model authoring software being used on the project
The BIM/s are to include spatial data defining designed net square metres, net volume and hold data to develop the room finish schedule/s, including room name, number and department 
Model elements must be integrated and synchronised with the space planning database (if used) including the architectural, mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and fire protection services models.

All smaller scales (i.e. 1:20, 1:10, 1:5, 1:2) are to be derived from the BIM/s and supplemented with 2D detail unless otherwise agreed by a Queensland Health representative and nominated in the DBEP 
Supplementary 2D linework on the drawings may be required by the scale, in order to facilitate successful model coordination, quantity and cost extraction. For those details and enlarged sections agreed by the Queensland Health representative, not to be derived from the BIM/s, Model Element Authors are to ensure that geometry and data depicting the details and enlarged sections are coordinated with model elements. Details with significant drafted content such as 'standard' and 'typical' details are not to contradict the model elements and shall utilise the BIM as an underlay when possible for the purposes of verification and coordination
Any 2D drawings not derived from the BIM/s must be documented in the DBEP in Section 6.6
All Schedules and Room Data Sheets (RDS) are to be produced from the data in the space planning database or, where this is not practicable, data in the BIM/s.

Project implementation – construction  
See CBEP documentation.
Technical 
The following section reflects the expected uses for BIM on the project, aligned to the PIR. Changing uses of BIM during the project changes the scope of service previously agreed/documented and has contractual implications. To reduce the risk of disputes, manage changes in conformance with the terms and conditions in agreements and contracts and keep a cumulative record of agreed changes in a constant location, e.g. the BEP. Each version of the BEP should highlight changes agreed since the issue of the previous version.
Software selection
PIR Section 2.3, 4.6, 4.8 - 4.10. Add other Delivery Team members and software as necessary.
The Delivery Team chosen (buildingSMART IFC certified) BIM authoring tools are recorded in Table 10. Once endorsed by the Delivery Team, use of different versions is not permitted without approval from the nominated Queensland Health representative.  
Table : Software selection
Project common data environment
PIR 2, 4.11 nominates the project CDE for design and how access will be managed for Queensland Health representatives. 
[enter CDE details here or refer to relevant documents]
Information status, revision and classification
Document the proposed approach to managing the information containers held within the CDE, such as status (Concept, SD, DD, CD) revision (1,2,3, and A, B, C etc) and information container classification. Check the Aconex guide if relevant

Table : Model Exchange Frequency
IFC
At each project stage, beyond Schematic Design, discipline/trade BIM/s shall be provided to Queensland Health in both native and IFC formats. Native formats provide a method for future works and asset management and maintenance activities, however, IFC is the mandated openBIM format. All BIM/s shall be exported as buildingSMART IFC 2X3 format, however, there is a preference for IFC 4 if all BIM authoring tools on the project are both import and export compatible. 
In addition to other project and BIM deliverables, a Federated IFC Model in IFC format is required at each project stage from DD onwards. All IFC models shall be exported from the BIM authoring tool with the custom Queensland Health parameters (refer to Section 6.5.4) mapped to the Queensland Health IFC User Defined Property Sets. This gathers all of the Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters conveniently together.
Table : Custom IFC user defined property sets
The mapping should also remove the QH_ prefix to all parameter names. The Property Sets retain their QH_ prefix. In future, a more integrated approach may be taken to better align Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters with native properties of the IFC schema.
Export settings (revit to IFC)
The below steps outline the process to deliver an IFC format BIM from Autodesk Revit. Other authoring tools should follow the same principles with regards to mapping Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters to custom IFC Property Sets as defined in Section 6.5.2.
Figure : Step 1 - Exporting IFC from Revit
In the relevant 3D export view in Revit (refer to Figure 1: Step 1 - Exporting IFC from Revit):
Select File 
Select Export
Select IFC
Select Modify setup
Figure : Step 2 - Exporting IFC from Revit
In the Modify Setup dialogue box (refer to Figure 2):
Select the Property Sets tab, ensure relevant tick boxes are checked
Browse to and select the Queensland Health IFC Export Mapping file
Click OK and export as usual
Other settings may be adjusted as required but the result shall be all Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters being successfully mapped to the relevant QH custom Property Set tab in IFC (refer to Figure 3)
Figure : Example IFC showing QH_Asset Property Set tab
Data standards
PIR Section 2.4, 3.3, 4.1(c), 4.12 and 4.13. Appointed Parties to document the HHS asset data standards to be used e.g. floor/level naming, building, room name and numbering and asset coding.
The following asset data standards and HHS specific naming /coding requirements shall be used.
HHS building, floor/level and zoning naming
PIR Section 4.1(m). Appointed Parties shall use HHS coding. Engage with the relevant QH representative to obtain the necessary details, such as Functional Location Code values, level naming, etc., at the beginning of the project.
[enter here]
AusHFG room coding
Along with the nominated room naming and numbering schema, the AusHFG coding of rooms in BIM shall be used. This includes Room Code, Room Name, Room Description, Department, etc. Refer to Section 6.5.4 for required parameters and the Australasian Health Facilities Guidelines for further details. 
BIM object coding
PIR Section 2.8, 2.9.2.1, 4.1 and 4.10. Appointed Parties to use QS and AusHFG coding.
Each Furniture, Fixture and Equipment (FF&E) model element must contain the AusHFG coding. The AusHFG model resource provides a free library of health facilities components for those organisations that are new to BIM. For more information see the Australasian Health Facilities Guidelines website.
All FF&E shall also contain the Group value (Group 1, 2 or 3) relating to the supplier/installer.
Uniclass classification
Queensland Health has recently implemented the Uniclass 2015 classification system. This is part of a phased implementation, with assets appearing on the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists initially requiring codes from the Systems (Ss) and Products (Pr) tables.
Where a Uniclass code has been supplied in the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists, it may be necessary to add another level of depth depending on the specific product or system being installed. 
For example, an Air Handling Unit has a provided product code of Pr_60_65_03, however when specifying an AHU a more specific code may now be relevant, e.g. Pr_60_65_03_XX. This may also impact the provided System code. It is expected that all Uniclass codes are updated as necessary to match the most appropriate level as shown in Table 13.
Table : Uniclass 2015 code format
Further information about the implementation of Uniclass is presented in the Queensland Health Uniclass 2015 Guidelines. 
Asset information requirements
The minimum AIR required by Health Capital Division are documented below in Section 6.5.4, however, various Computerised Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) may be used by each HHS, and their asset needs may vary. 
The AIR is the minimum compulsory asset information deliverable. Consultation with the HHS Facilities Manager during early project design stages shall agree to the extent of additional AIR. Consideration of how critical information will be transposed between the PIM and the AIM shall be sought early in the project.
Collaboration with the HHS Facilities Manager will provide much of the needed Queensland Health defined project specifics, such as level naming, approved manufacturers, mandatory service providers, etc.
Functional location codes
The spatial location of all assets is important for Queensland Health to be able to successfully manage them. Functional Location Codes (FLC) are unique identifiers used for this purpose across all of Queensland Health. Refer to the Queensland Health Functional Location Standard or consult the Queensland Health PM for instruction on how to generate FLCs. See Figure 4 below for an extract showing a breakdown of the FLCs. 
Figure :  Functional Location Naming
Asset grouping
Queensland Health categorises assets into one of six asset groups. If any BIM object falls into one of these groups, it shall be treated as an asset and the relevant data shall be captured. For the relationships of these groups and their descriptions, refer to Figure 5 and the summaries below. This should be read in conjunction with Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists.
Building – asset data captured for the whole building/model (not against individual objects). Refer to Table 14: Parameters for Assets (Buildings and Spaces). All Building parameters should be mapped to the QH_Building user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcBuilding elements.
Spaces – asset data captured for each room/space. Refer to Table 14: Parameters for Assets (Buildings and Spaces). All Spaces (room) parameters should be mapped to the QH_Space user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcSpace elements.
Systems – asset data captured once for each system (not sub-components) on the provided Systems sheet of the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists only. Refer to Table 15: Parameters for Assets (System, Equipment, Miscellaneous). All System parameters should be mapped to the QH_System user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcSystem.  
Major Equipment – asset data captured for each piece of equipment/plant on the provided Major Equipment sheet of the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists. Refer to Table 15: Parameters for Assets (System, Equipment, Miscellaneous). All equipment asset parameters should be mapped to the QH_Asset user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcElement.
Minor Equipment – asset data captured for each piece of equipment on the provided Minor Equipment sheet of Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists only. Refer to Table 15: Parameters for Assets (System, Equipment, Miscellaneous). All equipment asset parameters should be mapped to the QH_Asset user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcElement.
Miscellaneous – asset data captured for each item on the provided Miscellaneous sheet of the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists only. Refer to Table 15: Parameters for Assets (System, Equipment, Miscellaneous). All equipment asset parameters should be mapped to the QH_Asset user defined IFC PropertySet - applies to IfcElement.
Figure : Queensland Health Asset Grouping
Queensland health asset equipment lists
Systems, Major Equipment, Minor Equipment and Miscellaneous assets are itemised in the Queensland Health Asset Equipment Lists, with assets listed under the relevant sheet for each group, as seen in Figure 6. 
Figure : Example of the Equipment List
This Equipment List defines whether an item is treated as an asset - any item on these lists shall be considered an asset and the data relevant to the grouping shall be captured against the asset in BIM. 
Asset data should only be entered once against each asset. 
System data should only be entered once at the system level – not at the component level. Any item not on these lists does not require asset data.
However, this doesn’t mean other BIM requirements do not apply. For example, all model elements appearing in the AusHFG shall be populated with the relevant AusHFG code, Group number and FLC, etc, as specified elsewhere in this PIR. 
Refer to the tables in the following sections for the specific asset parameters required for each asset group.
Asset attributes (BIM parameters)
The list of parameters used in BIM is detailed in this section. Queensland Health has prefixed all parameter names with QH_ as they relate directly to Queensland Health's needs. These parameters are available preconfigured for the project environment in Autodesk Revit 2021. It is understood that not all designers use this BIM authoring tool and it is hoped that future versions may provide preconfigured parameters for other applications if requested. 
Schedules for each asset group have been provided in the Queensland Health Project Schedules (Revit)_2021.rvt file and should be copied into each model using the instructions contained in the file (refer to Figure 7).
Figure : Adding parameters and exporting asset schedules
Refer Queensland Health BIM Shared Parameters.txt available from September 2022
Refer Queensland Health Project Schedules (Revit).rvt available from September 2022
If these documents aren’t compatible with selected BIM authoring tools, use the lists provided below to configure the parameters.
How to read the tables
The arrows under the abbreviated project stages columns indicate the direction of information flow at each project stage.
◄ Indicates information required from Queensland Health to enable the population of this field
► Indicates information being exchanged by the Delivery Team to Queensland Health
Where the Required? field is Mandatory, a value must be provided
Where the Required? field is Conditional, a value must be provided if one exists. (E.g. if a room has an AusHFG code it must be populated. If no AusHFG code exists for that room type then no value is required.) 
Refer to the Queensland Health BIM Data Uploader Template.xlsx for data types and field constraints.
Refer to the PIR for additional information.
Building and space (room) parameters
Table : Parameters for Assets Buildings (BLD) and Spaces (SPC)
System and equipment parameters
Table : Parameters for Assets System (SYS), Major Equipment (MJR), Minor Equipment (MIN), Miscellaneous (MSC)
BIM data uploader 
All populated asset data is to be exported at each project stage from Detailed Design onwards, as indicated with the arrows in the tables of Section 6.5.4, and provided to Queensland Health in the Queensland Health BIM Data Uploader Template.xlsx. 
The data uploader from each discipline is to be consolidated into a single document by the Delivery Team BIM Manager prior to delivery at each project stage. There should only be one row per asset.
This data is used to ensure suitable testing and compliance checks can be undertaken throughout project delivery and that the final handover will be fully compatible with Queensland Health’s SAP and individual HHS needs. 
The Queensland Health BIM Data Uploader Template.xlsx is structured to align with the asset grouping (refer to Section 6.5.2), with one sheet for each asset group. Only the relevant parameter columns are present on each sheet, meaning all cells should be populated for each row (except for non-applicable conditional values). This makes it easier for the Delivery Team to export schedules from their BIM authoring tool that are filtered and grouped by asset group type.
2 Documentation
PIR Section 2 (c). Appointed Parties to document any 2D documentation not derived from BIM e.g. typical details.
The following 2D documentation is not derived from BIM. 
Table : 2D documentation external to BIM
Schedules
PIR Section 2 and 2 (c). Appointed Parties are to generate all schedules as extractions from the discipline/trade BIM/s and/or space planning tool. Any schedule not produced by these means must be documented here. The approach for coordinating these detached schedules with other information containers (BIM, space planning database etc) must be documented and approved by the Queensland Health representative prior to undertaking this work.
[list schedules not from BIM and detail the approach to coordinating these schedules with BIM here]
Room data sheets 
PIR Section 3.4 and 3.6. Appointed Parties must nominate the approach for producing RDS for the project, as one element of the overall Project Information Model.
[enter approach to generating and coordinating RDS contents here]
Federated model and coordination 
PIR Section 4.5.  the Delivery Team is to document the approach to managing hard clashes; construction tolerances; safe working/maintenance zones; responsibilities and accountabilities; clash detection priorities; tolerance strategy; and outputs (e.g. coordination reports, dashboarding etc.)
General
The Delivery Team are to use automated conflict checking/clash detection software during Schematic Design onwards to determine geometric clashes in each discipline/trade BIM and then in the Federated Model. Once issues are identified, each discipline/trade shall resolve the model elements within the BIM/s they are responsible for. 
The coordination issue identification and reporting should be held regularly (e.g. weekly or fortnightly) during the last half of Schematic Design and throughout Detailed Design and Construction Documentation. These reports should show any outstanding coordination issues between the Delivery Team members. 
Queensland Health expects the coordination to be appropriate to the stage of the project (e.g. reducing coordination issues as the project progresses). Major space planning coordination issues between Architecture, Structure, Mechanical and other relevant services should be resolved by the end of Detailed Design. Construction coordination should be largely resolved by the end of Construction Documentation. 100% Design projects should be fully coordinated and constructable.
Tolerances
The Delivery Team must set minimum tolerances for clash detection for project stage deliverables. These tolerances may vary between stages for example moving from a 100mm tolerance at Schematic Design to a 25mm tolerance during Construction Documentation.  
[enter tolerances here]
 Clash tests
[All information required to undertake clash tests must be documented in the DBEP]
Consider which stage of the project various clash tests are most appropriate for, e.g. focussing on Architectural vs Structural earlier, before introducing  services. All information required to undertake clash tests must be documented below.
[enter clash test strategy here]
All other clashes
While the above clashes have been assigned priorities, other clashes will exist within the BIM/s. These other clashes are not ignorable, nor should they be discarded.  The intention is to have a Federated Model that has minimal coordination issues prior to completion of each project stage. There must be documented proof that the Delivery Team has addressed the coordination issues, where identified.
Co-ordination responsibilities
The Delivery Team BIM Manager facilitates the overall co-ordination and management of clashes during the design phases 
The Services Consultants are responsible for discovering, managing and resolving clashes between services disciplines prior to the issue of discipline BIM/s to the BIM Manager for clash detection
Clash resolution meetings during design phases
Consider what outcomes are expected from clash meetings – are designers attending to resolve issues or are BIM coordinators attending to prioritise identified issues in the issue tracking software, etc. What is the approach to hosting productive clash meetings?
[enter the approach for clash resolution meetings here]
Clash detection meetings during construction phase

Asset Information Requirements (AIR) | Information requirements in relation to the operation of the asset. As per ISO19650
BIM Execution Plan (BEP) | A detailed plan, created from the Queensland Health BEP Template, that documents the use of BIM on a project. It outlines who is responsible for what in the BIM process, when in the process they are responsible for it, and how they will execute Queensland Health requirements as specified in the Project Information Requirements (PIR) and Capital Infrastructure Requirements (CIR)
BEP Template | The standard Queensland Health Building Information Modelling (BIM) Execution Plan Template to be used by Delivery Teams. Refers to Design BEP (DBEP) and Construction BEP (CBEP)
Building Information Modelling (BIM) | The use of a shared digital representation of a built asset to facilitate design, construction and operation processes to form a reliable basis for decisions
Building Information Models (BIM/s) | Means all models that any contributing party (or its sub-contractors) is required to produce and deliver in accordance with the BEP, PIR and CIR
BIM Manager | A Delivery Team provided resource to manage the BIM and asset information creation processes on the project
Delivery Team | A collection of Appointed Parties contributing to capital works project – the composition of which may change according to the project requirements and schedule, but typically comprises design consultants, Contractor and sub-Contractors, as per ISO 19650. For the purposes of this document, the Delivery Team excludes Queensland Health and its internal Project Managers as its representatives
Exchange Information Requirements (EIR) | Queensland Health requirements to enable the exchange of information from the (Project Information Model) PIM to the AIM. In this instance, the EIR is combined with the PIR to reduce the number of documents to be reviewed by the Delivery Team
Federated Model | An assembly of discipline/trade BIM/s combined for uses such as coordination, collaboration, and exchange with the Appointing Party
Key Decision | A business decision that Queensland Health values which can be made using information created by the Delivery Team   
Level of Development (LOD) | The degree to which the element’s geometry and attached information have been progressed and the degree to which Delivery Team members may rely on the information when using the model. Queensland Health doesn’t specify the LOD requirements per stage, however, if the Delivery Team wishes to use LOD, the 2021 US BIM forum specification shall be used as a guiding principle
Level of Information | The specific asset data associated with the individual objects within the BIM
Level of Information Need | The level of information need provides methods for describing information to be exchanged according to the EIR and namely the PIR
Laser Scanning | The process of capturing digital information about the shape of an object with equipment that uses a laser to measure the distance between itself and the object, the resulting output is a point cloud
Massing Model | An early volumetric model useful for understanding bulk and scale, areas of floor plates and departmental layouts and adjacencies
Model Content Plan (MCP) | A Quantity Surveyor (QS) developed document that defines the modelling requirements (units of measure, codification) for the Delivery Team to enable the QS to perform cost estimating from BIM
Model Element | An individual component within a BIM (e.g. wall, floor, nurse call device, room, diffuser, column etc)
Model Element Author | A person responsible for creating an element (object) in the BIM environment
openBIM | A universal approach to the collaborative design, realisation and operation of buildings based on open standards and workflows
Photogrammetry | The process of extracting 3D information from photos or video to convert into digital models or point clouds
Project Brief | Queensland Health requirements for a specific project
Project Information Model (PIM) | The information model relating to the delivery stage. The PIM consists of documentation, non-geometric information and geometric information of the project typically using BIM, CAD and GIS. As per ISO19650
Project Information Requirements (PIR) | Queensland Health information requirements and exchange processes to enable the creation and management of the PIM to support the ongoing AIM
Project Manager | A Queensland Health assigned resource to ensure the Delivery Team complies with the PIR and BEP enabling the creation of the PIM and AIM. The Project Manager's responsibility is to manage the scope, time, cost, quality, resources, communications, and risk aspects of the project
