BIM Execution Plan - ISO 19650 Compliant

Executive Summary
The BEP is a process management document which defines the process for an Owner and Delivery Team Members to develop a Project BIM Execution Plan. This BEP outlines the strategic approach to information management throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring compliance with ISO 19650 standards and the Employer's Information Requirements (EIR). The document establishes clear protocols for model development, data exchange, and collaborative workflows within the Common Data Environment (CDE).

The primary objectives of this BEP include establishing a robust framework for information delivery, defining roles and responsibilities across the project team, implementing quality assurance procedures, and ensuring seamless coordination between all appointed parties. This plan responds directly to the EIR, noting the proposed strategic objectives of both the Employer and the project activities to be undertaken.

Project Information Overview
This project requires comprehensive BIM implementation across all design and construction phases. The Delivery Team shall produce coordinated federated models at key project milestones, incorporating architectural, structural, MEP, and civil engineering disciplines. Information shall be delivered in accordance with the agreed Information Delivery Plan, with specific emphasis on data quality, consistency, and compliance with UK BIM Framework standards.

The project team will utilize industry-standard BIM authoring tools including Autodesk Revit for architectural and MEP design, Tekla Structures for structural engineering, and Civil 3D for civil infrastructure. All models must be developed to the Level of Information Need specified for each project stage, ensuring appropriate geometric and alphanumeric detail.

BIM Uses and Objectives
The following BIM uses have been identified as essential for project delivery: 3D coordination to identify and resolve spatial conflicts prior to construction, 4D sequencing for construction planning and logistics coordination, 5D cost estimation linked to model elements, design authoring across all disciplines, and As-Built documentation for facilities management handover.

Additional BIM uses include energy analysis to validate sustainability targets, structural analysis integration, lighting analysis, code compliance validation, and asset information modeling for operational phase requirements. Each BIM use shall be executed in accordance with documented procedures and quality control checkpoints.

Roles and Responsibilities
The Information Manager serves as the primary coordinator for all information management activities, ensuring compliance with the BEP and ISO 19650 standards. The Information Manager chairs coordination meetings, reviews model submissions for compliance, manages the CDE workflow, and reports on information delivery progress to the project board.

Lead Appointed Party responsibilities include overall project BIM coordination, federated model creation and maintenance, clash detection and resolution coordination, and ensuring timely information delivery by all appointed parties. The Lead Appointed Party must ensure all deliverables meet the Employer's requirements and comply with agreed standards.

Task Team responsibilities include developing discipline-specific models to agreed standards, participating in coordination meetings, resolving assigned clashes and design issues, submitting information according to the agreed schedule, and maintaining model quality throughout the project lifecycle. Each Task Team must designate a Task Information Manager responsible for information quality within their discipline.

Collaboration Procedures and Workflows
All project information shall be managed through an ISO 19650 compliant Common Data Environment with clearly defined information containers for each discipline and project phase. The CDE workflow comprises four key states: Work in Progress (WIP) for active development, Shared for coordination and review, Published for approved information, and Archive for superseded information.

Model coordination meetings shall occur bi-weekly during design development phases, with increased frequency during critical coordination periods. All appointed parties must submit models to the Shared area at least 48 hours prior to coordination meetings to allow adequate review time. Clash detection reports must be distributed within 24 hours of coordination meetings, with assigned parties responsible for resolution within agreed timeframes.

Information exchange protocols require all model submissions to include native file formats, IFC exports for coordination, and PDF documentation for review purposes. Metadata requirements include project code, originator code, volume/system identifier, level/location, document type, role, and classification according to Uniclass 2015 taxonomy.

Model Requirements and Data Standards
All BIM models must be developed using project-specific templates incorporating agreed naming conventions, classification systems, and level of information need specifications. Geometric modeling shall follow established LOD (Level of Development) criteria appropriate to each project stage, ensuring models contain sufficient detail for their intended purpose without excessive information that could impact performance.

Alphanumeric information attached to model elements must comply with the project's data schema, incorporating mandatory parameters for asset identification, specification references, maintenance requirements, and warranty information. COBie-compliant data must be embedded within models to facilitate seamless handover to facilities management systems.

Model file naming shall follow the structure: PRJ-ORIG-VOL-LVL-TYPE-ROLE-CLASS-NUMBER, where each component is clearly defined in the project naming convention standard. This ensures consistent file identification across all disciplines and project phases.

Quality Assurance and Validation
Quality control procedures include automated model checking against project standards using validation software, manual design reviews at defined hold points, and peer review processes for complex design elements. Each model submission must be accompanied by a quality control checklist confirming compliance with technical standards.

Validation checks include geometry validation to identify modeling errors, classification verification ensuring correct Uniclass coding, data completeness checks confirming all required parameters are populated, and clash detection across federated models. Models failing validation criteria will be rejected and returned to the originating party for correction.

Information Delivery Planning
The Master Information Delivery Plan (MIDP) establishes the overarching schedule for information delivery across all project stages, aligned with RIBA Plan of Work stages and contractual milestones. The MIDP identifies key decision points requiring specific information deliverables and coordinates inputs from all appointed parties.

Task Information Delivery Plans (TIDPs) detail discipline-specific deliverables, including model files, drawings, specifications, schedules, and data sets. Each TIDP specifies the information container, format, level of information need, responsible party, and delivery date for each deliverable. TIDPs must be maintained and updated throughout the project to reflect approved changes to scope or schedule.

Key information delivery milestones include Stage 3 Developed Design submission with spatially coordinated models, Stage 4 Technical Design with construction-ready information, Stage 5 As-Built documentation reflecting constructed conditions, and Stage 6 Handover with complete O&M information and COBie data sets.

Technology and Software Standards
The project team shall utilize the following BIM authoring platforms: Autodesk Revit 2023 or later for architectural and MEP disciplines, Tekla Structures 2023 or later for structural engineering, Autodesk Civil 3D 2023 for civil infrastructure, and Navisworks Manage 2023 for coordination and clash detection.

All models must be capable of exporting IFC 2x3 or IFC4 files for coordination purposes, ensuring interoperability across different software platforms. The project coordinate system shall be established using Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinates, with agreed project origin and orientation documented in the BEP appendices.

Cloud-based collaboration platforms include Autodesk Construction Cloud for CDE functionality, document management, and model coordination. All project stakeholders must have appropriate access permissions configured by the Information Manager based on their role and information needs.

Health and Safety Information Management
BIM models shall incorporate health and safety information relevant to design risk assessments and construction planning. Identified hazards must be clearly documented within model elements using designated parameters, with links to detailed risk assessments and mitigation measures in the project health and safety file.

Construction sequencing models (4D) must consider temporary works requirements, access constraints, and high-risk activities. The Principal Designer shall review BIM models to verify adequate consideration of health and safety risks and ensure compliance with CDM regulations.

As-Built and Handover Requirements
As-Built models must accurately represent constructed conditions, incorporating all approved design changes and site variations. The construction team is responsible for maintaining As-Built model accuracy throughout the construction phase, with updates required within two weeks of significant changes.

COBie data shall be progressively populated throughout design and construction phases, with final validation prior to handover. Required COBie sheets include Facility, Floor, Space, Zone, Type, Component, System, Assembly, Connection, Spare, Resource, Job, and Document. All COBie data must pass validation against the COBie UK 2012 schema.

Handover deliverables include native BIM models, IFC exports, COBie data sets, O&M documentation linked to model elements, asset registers, and comprehensive as-built drawings. The Employer's facilities management team must confirm acceptance of all handover information prior to project closeout.

Post-Handover Asset Information Management
The Employer shall utilize delivered asset information within their Computer-Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) system for ongoing operations and maintenance activities. BIM models and associated data will support space management, preventive maintenance scheduling, energy monitoring, and future refurbishment planning.

The Information Manager shall coordinate handover training sessions for the Employer's facilities team, ensuring they understand how to access, navigate, and utilize delivered BIM information effectively. Documentation must include user guides, data schemas, and contact information for ongoing technical support.
